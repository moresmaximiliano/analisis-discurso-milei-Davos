Blaming socialism for the evils that lie in the third world is preposterous.  It is the exploitation of their markets and natural resources by international corporations.  And anyone who really believes this drivel that is on this video, has to look at Nazi Germany.  Yes when you meld corporations with government, you get facism and its a very efficient system to deliver comfortable lives for those who cooperate with the system.  But goodbye freedom and say hi to a state of fear....."

I mean, nice words, but the actual fact is that capitalism generated socialism for the little people while they (the capitalists) enjoy favours and tax cuts from bought politicians. Look where we are and where we are heading because of this... its good that we can solve &quot;global warming&quot; by imposing greater taxes for the people  and spending trilions of dollars but we can&#39;t solve homelesness, world hunger or poverty. I get the feeling he is talking for freedoms for corporations and not for the little guy. He doesn&#39;t say anything of use. Just nice words wrapped at the benefit of capitalist corporations. If the state is not the solution then what is? Corporations? Wealthy antreprenors? Its all about the money and with that in the way there is no room for kindness, sacrifice, altruism, caring if there is no money to make. Maybe the state controlled and payed by corporations is not the solution. That I agree."

It destroys us in our minds, body and spirit. People are brainwashed into thinking they are better off being told what to do, how to think, how to act, etc. It just doesn&#39;t work economically or in any other status of being a human. We were given minds to learn, experience, explore on this planet but it would be nice if we would stop fighting each other so much and learn to be more compassionate, caring and respectful to our fellow humans.

He&#39;s basically advocating for lessaiz-faire economy, no-state, just businesses. So, anarcho-capitalism. It&#39;s just baffling to me how one can propose such a thing, when some big businesses, if left unchecked, will wreck havoc on the planet, the environment, society etc like they have for hundreds of years now. Yes, capitalism has taken us far, but the system only cares about profit and the accumulation of capital. Social, environmental responsibility isn&#39;t written into it, that&#39;s why there has to be an entity (call it the state) that handles such inefficiencies. Yes, too much concentrated power on the state is bad, but capitalism if left unchecked leads to big monopolies --&gt; a few companies taking over. On the one hand capitalists say the state is bad because it holds too much power, on the other leftists-statists-collectivists say capitalism is bad because it leads to capital accumulation on a few hands. Both of them are right!! Problem isn&#39;t with capitalism or socialism, the problem is with CONCENTRATED POWER. We must not let either big businesses get too big, buy everything, destroy the planet, or big governments have too much power, drown-out businesses, spread corruption etc. <br>It&#39;s really sad to not see people try to see things objectively anymore. I&#39;m either bombarded by leftists or anarchocapitalists. Anyways, inequality is at an all-time-high.

More than anything: &quot;global GDP increase was stagnant up until 1800s&quot; is really saying; large scale increase in GPD happened when we departed the Gold standard of currency. Before this time to make more money you had to dig it out of the ground or steal it from someone else. <br><br>After this you just had to print and leverage more from the bank. Of course the economy grew. I would like to see this data offset against inflation.

In every way they reducing costs (using cheaper materials, generating more toxic waste and just sink it) to achieve more profit. Raising prices, markets want more profit so they raising prices too... They say the population damaging the earth... So raising prices.. But in reality the extreme growing profit hunger damaging the earth and the peoples health. Rich ones want to be more rich and want the other 99,99% to be as poor as possible.. to work hard and make more profit for them... It&#39;s like the car projects... E cars aren&#39;t saving anything just a good buisnes... Cars only producing about 1% emissions from the global emission rate... Carbon footprint? Toxic wastes from Li battery producting etc. Doesn&#39;t matter just buy our expensive e-car and burn the old ones. If we stop producting of short life scrap and start to make longlasting good stuff the cost would be barely higher.. If you buy a car and it last 30-40 or more yrs with minimal repair it much less carbon or toxic footprint. And not just cars.. In every way we should follow this and we save the world. Like light bulb cartel. Waste no matter if it profits. Electronical devices too. They got slow and working badly. Not because they got weaker or damaged. The companies want you to buy new one always.

@zZHotBurritoZz,2024-01-25 19:42:19+00:00,2024-01-25 19:42:19+00:00,1,"I have watched this video of Javier Milei&#39;s speech at the World Economic Forum and here&#39;s a summary of his main points for those who would rather read it than hear or watch it:<br><br>1. <b>*Free market capitalism*</b> is the only way to end world poverty. Javier Milei argues that free market capitalism has lifted 90% of the world&#39;s population out of poverty and is the only morally desirable system to achieve it. He cites the historical data that shows how economic growth has accelerated since the 19th century and that countries with free markets are much richer than those with repressed markets.<br><br>2. <b>*Socialism*</b> is a failed system that leads to poverty and misery. Javier Milei argues that socialism has always and everywhere been a failure, and that it is responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people. He claims that the main problem with the West today is that it is being undermined by its own leaders who are advocating for socialism.<br><br>3. <b>*Neoclassical economic theory*</b> is flawed and leads to socialism. Javier Milei argues that neoclassical economic theory is based on a flawed model of the market, and that this leads to regulations that hinder economic growth and open the door to socialism. He claims that the solution to market failures is not more regulation, but less.<br><br>4. The <b>*West*</b> is in danger of embracing socialism. Javier Milei argues that the West is facing a significant threat because its leaders are co-opted by a world that inevitably leads to socialism. He warns that if the West continues on this path, it will condemn itself to poverty and misery.<br><br>5. <b>*Entrepreneurs*</b> are heroes who contribute to society. Javier Milei argues that entrepreneurs are not villains, but heroes who create jobs and contribute to the well-being of society. He encourages entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by the political class and to continue to create wealth.<br><br>6. The moral underpinnings of <b>*free market capitalism*</b> are superior to those of socialism. Javier Milei claims that free markets incentivize hard work and innovation, while socialism rewards idleness and discourages individual achievement.<br><br>7. Specific examples of how <b>*free markets*</b> have lifted people out of poverty are provided. Javier Milei mentions the economic booms in China and India in recent decades, and attributes these to their embrace of free market principles.<br><br>8. Acknowledging that <b>*free markets*</b> are not perfect, Javier Milei argues that the benefits of free markets far outweigh the drawbacks, and that the best way to address inequality is through economic growth, not government redistribution.<br><br>9. Javier Milei criticizes what he sees as a growing trend of <b>*anti-capitalism*</b> in the West. He blames this trend on a number of factors, including the rise of social media, the decline of traditional institutions, and the increasing influence of identity politics.<br><br>10. Javier Milei concludes with a **call to action**, urging viewers to defend free markets and to fight against the spread of socialism. He believes that the future of the West depends on our ability to preserve the principles of individual liberty and economic freedom.<br><br>Even though some details might be missed in this summary, I hope that you found it useful."

It&#39;s easy to say that capitalism reduces poverty when you make up what poverty even means. That&#39;s a ridiculous standard to set any ideology on. This man is living in the capitalism of the early 1900s where mega conglomerates were barely an idea in someone&#39;s greedy little head. We don&#39;t live in that world anymore. Every brand is owned by some other company which is owned by another, and they decide who can compete and when. It&#39;s delusional to believe that our progress as a human race is because of capitalism, we are where we are despite capitalism. Much of the progress we have made in the modern era has been delayed because something that was groundbreaking wasn&#39;t marketed enough or didn&#39;t make it to the people who could see its potential. How many times could we have leaped forward in an industry but didn&#39;t because corporations not only refuse to innovate but become so powerful that they can BURY anyone who tries? ANY system run by people will always be flawed, be it socialism, communism, democracy, or what have you. The only reason there is relative stability is because of the checks and balances we have created, not because of the economic system that constantly seeks to overthrow them."

To speak about freedom and to mean economical freedom is nothing but a belief in an idea that proved itself wrong already a hundred years ago.<br>You can insist on a ststem that gave birth to the parasitic system of financial economics. But in the end you or your offspring will starve, and die in the home called earth, poisoned by your economic and technical adventures. It took this system just 150 years to bring our species to the brink of extinction and we refuse to learn!

One person went to jail, taxpayers bailed out the super-rich banks and CEOs etc walked away with their massive annual bonuses, supposedly performance-based bonuses. Obviously, I am in a topsy-turvy land at the top of the Faraway Tree, where upper-middle-class, right-wing dictators and military juntas, who were hugely and covertly supported by US (Operation Condor, Red Condor on and, very tragically, on) tortured and disappeared hundreds and thousands of Argentinian citizens, especially students."

Milei called her rivals everything from &quot;diabolical dwarves&quot; to &quot;blood-sucking parasites&quot;.<br>Milei is a dog lover and on this point there is something to say. His former favorite dog, Conan, has his own Wikipedia page. Milei has claimed that he and Conan first met in the Colosseum in a past life. Back then, 2,000 years ago, Conan was a lion and Milei a gladiator. But instead of fighting to the death, they became best friends.<br>Conan has since been cloned and these four clones are all named after economists that Milei likes and is inspired by.<br>Javier Milei often seeks out mediums and claims to be able to communicate with his late dog Conan. Incidentally, it was in a medium trip like this that Conan, together with God, is said to have persuaded Milei to stand in the presidential election in the first place.<br>Milei has had a verbal spat with Pope Francis, who is also from Argentina. He has called the Pope a &quot;disgusting leftist&quot; and accused him of consorting with &quot;communist murderers&quot;. Something for which he later apologized.<br>There has been much speculation about the relationship with sister Karina in Argentina. Politicians usually don&#39;t bother to comment on these types of issues, but in direct connection with the election last winter, Javier Milei took to social media with a denial: That he does not have a sexual relationship with his own sister.<br>Purely in terms of appearance, Milei stands out. His well-grown sideburns bring to mind the superhero Wolverine. He himself has said that he never does his hair, but rather sticks his head out the car window on the way to work in the morning and lets the wind do the trick.<br>Milei is behind several controversial proposals. Among other things, he wants to ban abortion again, which became legal in Argentina only four years ago, and has opened up to allow organ sales.&quot;<br><br>I wont even bother to say what I think I just copy pasted some information, people should read a lot and analyse a lot before believing everything people tell them specially when so well put like he did...if people used more their skepticism many conflicts during history til today could have been avoided.<br>Only thing I will say thou about the topic of abortion, everyone deserves the freedom to dicide what to do with their bodies, abortion should be anyones right and religion should stay the hell out of it, for accident, rape, due to complications for the mother or baby, or even if you realise you cant give it a good life, so many children forced into the world due to this bullshit agaisnt abortion that suffer a lot during their lives if not all, die early or before being born...<br>So many of those children who turn out to be bad members of society (violent, criminals etc), if anything you know what you should focus your attention? not on abortion but on controlled parenting, by means of to be a good model ,responsible parent or not, and if not, not be allowed to have children, if only society would focus on the correct things, in a world where many societies have way to many children without any control whatsoever...<br><br>Seeing most of the comments here thou, I doubt anyone cares about what I just said and will just consider me a nobody with stupid ideologies :) I do believe the world needs a positive change in many fields, be it politically, financially, freedom, justice, law, anti corruption, stay away from privatising also since that will be the downfall of middle and lower class, if the state is failing its the fault of how it is structured and corruption inside of it , not that it doesnt work."

The nations with the highest standard of living on the planet are the nations with a relatively low Gini coefficient and high taxes. Good healthcare, a good educational system, good infrastructure. All state run. And most of the time highly efficient. The US healthcare system is not only inefficient, it is also extremely expensive. It&#39;s not entrepreneurship, which creates big incomes. It&#39;s size. Even in a diversified, export-oriented economy, like the one in Germany, the majority of profits is being raked in by the big, often monopoly like corporations. The Asian &quot;Tiger&quot;states plus China made their way to the top only by a rigid protective and subsidizing policy. Reduction of global poverty was manly made possible by communist China. One of the strongest economies in recent years was the one on communist Vietnam. Milei is a populist and he has no clue."

And the problem is that wealth can not be created. It can only be distributed which means there will always be more poor people in capitalism than rich people. And if there are no poor people it probably means that country as enslaved another country for free labour.

This is an attempt :<br><br>This speech sounds very good because he is basically saying that socialism (even partially) is hindering the free market capitalism with taxes, which is true. But the biggest critic of free market is monopoly and wealth unbalance. As well as corruption it can lead to. He only adresses it by saying he is against corrupt people and that dismantling monopoly will make things worse. This is a bit weak of an argument to me, even if we can praise him for wanting to fight corrupt people (could be a lie though, because they both want the same politics). He never adresses wealth unbalance, implying his system will fix it by itself. But this is wrong because unregulated markets automatically creates wealth unbalance, because it is based on the rule of the strongest, and people that draw the shortest stick will not have enough income to fulfill all their basic needs. People overall will have higher income, but the poorer will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to pay for everything at a higher price, and the &quot;freedom&quot; to chose between paying their bills OR go to a doctor. They will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to go to a doctor...if they go in debt, making their issues long-term worse. Cherry on the cake, this category of people will actually work the most essential jobs and harder ones. This cycle of chaos will keep going as long as the population is high enough, because the system can always replace the &quot;broken people&quot; (who will get sick and die sooner. Ah, isn&#39;t nature GREAT ?)<br>But this is all okay for him because he does not value all human beings the same. <br><br>He also never adresses the weight this system applies to the planet, which cannot be denied, and will even be more obvious in the next decades. Infinite growth is not possible in a limited (even if abundant) environnement.<br><br>Same for feminism. He did not say why it is bad.<br><br>So what&#39;s the solution from here ? I am not necessarily advocating for socialism. I can understand a lot of stuff he said was true in a way. But the complete lack of state and regulations he is advocating for is just an other extreme compared to socialism or communism. We dont need ideologies, we need case-by-case problem solving, starting from solving poverty, food and health issues.<br>Smart stuff was never implemented : what if linked the smallest and highest salary in a company by a factor ?<br>What if we put money in actual factory-side pollution capture ? This could be a new market !<br>Health should still be mutualised because it is not an indidivual-only issue !<br><br>We can create virtuous circles just by making better laws and regulations. We don&#39;t need to throw away everything."
@wehwalte,2024-01-24 10:43:39+00:00,2024-01-24 10:43:39+00:00,1,"Too bad capitalism doesn&#39;t exist only since the 19th century but since the 17th, people keep making this mistake of thinking is capitalism that generates wealth, it is not. Technological innovation generated the improvement of conditions, not capitalism. If anything, capitalism when unregulated slow down technological innovation. If we take one of the most capitalistic countries in the world, the US, and look at where their strongest growth period was, it was after the New Deal, where capitalistic practices had to be subdued to a stronger state regulations. If we take China well, not much to be said right? The fastest growing economy on earth, and they have a mixed system where capitalism is a tool of socialism, not the opposite.

Capitalism&#39;s &quot;gains&quot; are an illusion companies are constantly trying to keep up with growth expectations and eventually it will stagnate then the system will crash. We&#39;re still a ways off from market saturation but once the countries that capitalism uses for cheap labor overcome poverty they&#39;ll refuse to do the work for the same price and then where will the labor force come from to keep the growth so investors don&#39;t just pull their stocks and collapse all these companies.... There is a reason almost NONE of our companies make anything within western borders.

This, they say, leads to an increase in the welfare of the population.<br>But both the globalists and the WEF promote this very doctrine. None of them are against monopolists, <br>against corporations. They are against medium and small enterprises, against farmers, etc., <br>but not against oil companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc. And they are against states, <br>in favour of subordinating states to wholly international organisations funded by transnational corporations.<br>So Miley&#39;s speeches are fully in line with the WEF. But naive people think that if he is against <br>socialism and the state, he is also against the WEF. Quite The Opposite! The fact is that the WEF, <br>the globalists, are NOT for socialism and the state, they are for SLAVERY, as for example slavery <br>in the East India Company or slavery in the Third Reich (concentration camps), <br>Or slavery in the East India Company.

Within this economic paradigm, the emergence of private monopolies can, albeit unintentionally, give rise to an alternative private governance structure, ultimately resulting in limited substantial change. Furthermore, it is frequently noted that individuals who lack expertise in the domains of industry and engineering tend to engage in discussions that extend beyond their sphere of knowledge.<br><br>As a technocrat, my commitment to opposing the ignorance and arrogance exhibited by anarcho-capitalists, fascists, and proponents of unbridled capitalism remains unwavering, and I shall persist in this endeavor until the end of my days. The dystopian vision of our world is gradually materializing due to the dearth of expertise in the sectors that capitalists oversee. Consequently, the distinction between a 1% led by knowledgeable individuals as opposed to the continuation of crony capitalism, where expertise is often overlooked, becomes a matter of paramount significance. By embracing knowledge as the catalyst for change, we hold the potential to reshape the course of our future, paying homage to the legacy of visionaries like Nikola Tesla."

This created the monopoly we have today. So the theory is there, but it is not sustainable unless the monopoly is taxed to high heaven, but then they just move operations. UK has little or no industry now. Only financial growth by printing money that doesn&#39;t exist, keeps the uk afloat, the debt is increasing and the bubble is bursting, and taxes are being increased or else inflation and vat to claw money back. Only cheap overseas goods are keeping the economy afloat, and its funnelling all money out of the country as it goes to producers.

It makes for a great speech to blame every single problem in the world on one scapegoat though, his political opponents. If anyone is trying to convince you that what makes some people rich and others poor as the rich people are more free than the poor, time to start throwing some massive grains of salt. The people of China are significantly wealthier than those of Argentina, I don‚Äôt think anyone in Argentina would claim they are less free. It is possible to be rich and repressed or free and poor. I know it sounds really good to people struggling with economic hardship that all they need is a little more freedom and they can be just like the billionaires, but all that extra ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is just going to give them more power of you when you have to negotiate in the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù.

WE create the money with our signature which they take from our birth certificate trust account (which they control and trade on security exchanges) AND also have us pay them back with interest.

Like we have here in the US where our corrupt politicians take bribes and what not from large corporations like black rock and Walmart and other and so on so they‚Äôre allowed to grow and expand but the small guy trying to make a living with his family business is driven out of business. COVID also helped with that to cause only large corporations were allowed to stay open and small businesses had to shut down and eventually went broke and out of business

OFCOURSE they support capitalism -- it is front and center to their own interests as well. They don&#39;t want some UBI socialist world -- because that means the death of their mega-businesses. Where the WEF doesn&#39;t align with moral virtue, is that they will milk Governments instead if consumers are no longer consuming their goods. Basically they are all for taking your money one way or another -- and for their own business survival. All this proposal does is speak to the honest route of capitalism; rather than crony-capitalism."

WEF is always speaking for the top 1% who are not affected by any government interventions. If anything governments have been so corrupt as to pass laws that favour corporations and the rich - so that issues such as environmental sustainability and medical advancements if not advances in technology are controlled so as to benefit the rich and not the poor. <br><br>Meaning that we are not advancing and this social degradation that this so called leader is talking about is caused by government corruption not by the poor but by large corporations passing laws that degrade society. Of course this idiot is just another WEF puppet.

How that growth has been achieved by the hard work of the many while only the few have reaped the rewards. GDP per capita doesnt take into account redistribution of the wealth. The Great Pyramids also have been wonderful achievements but the slaves were given only water and bread while the pharaos were the owners of the pyramids. <br><br>GDP per Capita means nothing without wealth redistribution index. The only class that is growing in wealth is the rich class thus increasing artificially the average<br><br>2. The Free Market favors the richer trade partner- not poor countries. Poor countries cannot compete with rich countries- this is why the world is divided into 1 billion that leads normal lives and 7 billions that live in poverty. SO much for the achievements of capitalism. <br><br>Excuse my french but I dont wanna live in world where 1 out of 7 people lives good while the rest wallow in poverty so that 1 can live good.

How much do China and North Korea spend on &quot;controlling the masses&quot; and espionage rather than creating wealth, freedom, and safety in their countries?  I hoped Putin would see the power of a strong education system and economic freedom and use that to focus on building a stronger country.  Conversely, in the USA, it has been the economic powerhouses who have had corrupting influence over the system through lobbyists and media control.  In all of these &quot;collectivism&quot; cases, it ends up with leaders who think they know what is best rather than leaders who know how to maximize the untapped power of human capital.

Communism and socialism are bad, democracy is turning out to be socialism as it is abused and applied based closely to the tenants of socialism, so I believe that capitalism is the best way out so far but we cannot say that the abuse of capitalism is turning our social structure into a 2 tier society of poor and rich, the middle class is disappearing."

He implies that a capitalist government is better than a socialist government.  He is conflating the free market with monopoly excusing the resulting concentration of wealth as a benefit to all.  His libertarianism mixed with his neoliberal economics results in an oligarchical dictatorship like China where the population is doing better but there are few constraints on the rulers.  Russia is the end result of a capitalist oligarchical dictatorship where it&#39;s population&#39;s standard of living is below that of India.

Capitalism should be well governed to be successful.  The challenge is to find balance between regulation and the free market. Over regulation chokes the free market and unfettered capitalism takes advantage of labor, disgracing the dignity of those that work the hardest and do the most dangerous jobs. This is why labor movements are so important in the development of modern capitalism. So, I agree with his assessment of the benefits of capitalism but, in part, disagree with his criticism of regulation, or what he calls collectivism."

In places with unrestrained capitalism people are returning to poverty from middle class lifestyles. Gone are the days where it was feasible for a family on a normal income to own a house, now even those with high income jobs have trouble finding places to live in the cities where they need to work. Unrestrained free market capitalism is tearing itself appart and pushing people to take action in the west. What currently looks like is creating the best outcome is restrained free market capitalism, as seen in the EU and especially the the scandinavian countries.<br>Basically the flaw is that trickle down economics do not keep working, and at some stage instead starts to have the inverse effect, since at some point the persuit of profit generates tragedy of the commons effects, where to generate more profit for one side it causes greater harm elsewhere, at least initially just compariable to the effect of trickle down economics would have provided there. An example of where it is not just restrained to negative effects on trickle down economics is in terms of climate change, where a lot of economic activity have a more global negative impact causing huge losses, that when accounting for the total value generated puts the actual generated net value way down. Part of the problem here is that these costs are elsewhere and paid over a long periode of time in the future, so they have not showed up that much in historical data yet. Without some kind of intervension, then it is not possible to handle such negative side effects or keep having the general population actually have increasing wealth generation, as it comes down to issues like the tragedy of the commons, where the effect on one self is much smaller than the total effect, scewing the profit calculations."

@adrianperez4167,2024-01-22 15:44:44+00:00,2024-01-22 15:44:44+00:00,0,"&quot;¬°Viva la Libertad, carajo!&quot; is Javier Milei&#39;s &quot;war cry&quot;, with which he ends each of his public speeches. What does &quot;carajo&quot; mean? Well, &quot;carajo&quot;, was the basket of the Spanish caravels, at the top of the mast, where the lookout was located. But also, it was a place of punishment, of penance, and it was used as a threat: &quot;do it again, and you&#39;ll go to the carajo.&quot;<br><br>When trying to translate it into English, it has become &quot;Long live Freedom, damn&quot; or damn it. Which, when retranslated into Spanish, becomes &quot;viva la Libertad, maldita sea.&quot; But it does not reflect what is meant. Damn it&#39;s not a curse. It was the highest place on a ship, at the top and around the mast and above the yards. IT IS THE PLACE WHERE THE DISTANCES CAN BE SEEN, AND FROM WHERE THE SEEKER WARNS THE PROXIMITY OF FIRM LAND, OR OF A DANGER ON THE HORIZON. In Milei&#39;s case, he uses &quot;carajo&quot; for emphasis, using a word from &quot;lunfardo&quot; or slang,, from the town, and not from the academy.<br><br>When a sailor&#39;s behavior displeased the captain, he &quot;sent him to the carajo&quot;, where he had to stand, and without shelter from the wind and eventually, the cold and the rain. Hence, in the R√≠o de la Plata (Argentina and Uruguay), &quot;carajo&quot; has an enormity of uses, depending on the context of the sentence: in this case, it is a word that gives emphasis: &quot;I&#39;m telling you this for the last time, carajo&quot;, and it is used in very diverse ways ( see dictionaries). Therefore it is very difficult to translate, and it is better to leave it as is."

No one system is perfect. This is why we need to have a Hybrid monetary system. Using the words, &quot;Free market capitalism&quot; is like a loose canon.  It gives the idea that it is the only perfect system. Which it is not perfect. That&#39;s like saying only one religion is perfect for the whole planet. The reason that Free Market Capitalism does well, is because the process exploits workers though out the world. And FMC exploits the environment for sure. FMC pollutes the planet. If we all had free medical health care, then the businesses would not have to consider that cost when trying to start a new business venture. We do not want the whole world operating in a more unjust and irresponsible way.  We must consider all repercussions.  Most important to realize, the capitalist free market are given governmental funds often !!!  So the FMC are not financially successful all on their on."

The west is socialist, but not by the common definition of socialism, but by his own.<br>2. Capitalism is good because &quot;it took more than 90% of the worlds population out of poverty&quot;. By the way that isn&#39;t true. According to PIP the percent of people under the poverty line worldwide  was 37.8% in the 90-s and only went under 10% in 2017. If you will also look at the whole graph you&#39;ll see that the poverty actually went and still goes down in &quot;time of the evil socialism&quot;.<br>3. &quot;Monopoly is good&quot;. That one is actually based on the second argument, or on the premise that capitalism is unconditionally good for the people. That should in his opinion tell us that &quot;stopping monopolies is bad for the economy and therefore also for the people&quot;. Well at one point it may be true, BUT there are and have been enough examples of monopolists working against healthy concurrence and therefore against the free market. Or there are examples of monopolists straight up harming people like the Nestle&#39;s Infant Formula incident.<br><br>He is obviously not calling for the educated people out there.

No, people did not enjoy better times under the beginning of the industrial revolution, in fact, working in big factories was much worse than working in agriculture. No, capitalism is not an inherently better system for the everyday man. It does create wealth, but there is no written rule as to how that wealth is to be distributed. Collectivism isnt any better, since governments can fuck you over as well. This is populism. Fuck the wef, sure, but embracing even more freemarket values will not magically solve all of our problems."

There&#39;s a handful of oil companies that run the industry. There&#39;s a handful of supermarkets that run the groceries markets. <br>Essentially all small businesses are being wiped out and being replaced by afew big wigs. <br>So what he&#39;s saying is that capitalism is a model to follow?<br>Capitalism that led to two world wars? That led to invasions of Iraq and Syria and Palestine?
@zakucich7175,2024-01-22 11:53:03+00:00,2024-01-22 11:53:03+00:00,0,"1. Allowing the market to regulate itself is the reason why economic inequalities and monopolies exist. <br>2. If socialism has killed 100 million people, how many has capitalism killed?<br>3. The economist that coined GDP even said it was not supposed to be used as a metric of a country&#39;s success,  only the tracking of it&#39;s spending.<br>4. If the state hadn&#39;t been pressured through advocacy then intervened to promote women&#39;s rights through legislation they&#39;d still be barefoot and pregnant, treated as private property.<br>5. Capitalisms philosophy revolves around profit. Exponential,  unrestrained profit motives will continually push those already poor and disadvantaged into further poverty. Having less and less of the cake he speaks of.<br>6. If the state hadn&#39;t intervened in the west with social welfare the poor would be dead. <br>7. Libertarianism is vehemently opposed to state intervention. So if we allow free market corporations to have unfettered action in the economy, how do we tackle climate change? We got to this  point in history because of capitalism and the push for exponential profit gain. Corporations already have such a strangle hold on policy development which has seen price gouging, wars for resources and the plundering of underdeveloped countries for the benefit of share holders.<br>8. This speech, while articulate and has some good points, is myopic. Narrow minded. And ideologically opposed to the true freedom and liberation of all peoples by promoting profits over people. No change to the status quo. More of an enhancing of it under the guise of &quot;libertarianism&quot;."

The main problem though was, that those implementations were not about bringing justice or equality to the people. Stalin, Mao, Kim and the likes never intended build a better world. They just acted in self interested, to rule as almighty tyrants, creating oppressive and corrupt regimes.<br><br>We don‚Äòt have to look at one extreme on the scale, that is socialism. We also don‚Äòt automatically have to choose the other extreme, that being vulture capitalism.<br>Instead we should look towards creating a free market capitalism that is governed, regulated and guided to serve the people.<br>It makes no sense to regulate absolutely everything, because those would kill off any creativity and growth. But areas like water supply, infrastructure, healthcare, education should be accessible to everyone in need and affordable manner. Free market capitalism (american style) does not ensure that at all. In contrary actually. <br><br>In the social democratic countries of Europe we have found a nice place in between those two extremes.<br>Free market, but with certain ecological and social responsibilities enforced by the state. The implementation of those rules are up to the market players.<br>It‚Äòs not perfect, I admit that. But it combines the best parts of both worlds, eventually leasing to less corruption, less poverty, less inequality, less violence."

If the market is a truth teller, then why does it constantly lie to itself?<br><br>It&#39;s not like we live in an informational era where goods and services are marketed mainly through their to-be-perceived cultural relevance instead of more objective criteria. &quot;Buy X, and you&#39;ll look good in front of Y&quot; is what drives revenue today and what we see in ads... Where the fuck do you process any semblance of an objective and sane demand in this?<br><br>If a market that cares most about selling smartphones ABSOLUTELY NOBODY wanted anything to do with twenty years ago does not carry ideological bias, then call me a socialist, alright.<br><br>A free market isn&#39;t a catalyst for changes in consumption models, it&#39;s a catalyst for concentration in consumption models. It takes whatever the fuck works to generate transactions at the moment and forms obsessions, even bubbles, around it. This is not an expression of objective demand meeting objective supply, this is just an expression of collective craze.<br><br>When was the last fucking time the markets went insane over delivering quality and quantities of innovative food products? Yet, this is the pillar of us as a species: we need to eat. But the markets and their marketers don&#39;t give a flying fuck about food, whilst the average everyday man does give a fuck about it. When were the markets lastly crazed over concerns of making housing better? When were the markets lastly obsessed over making clothing durable and easy to wash over stimulating our innate need for cultural status through &quot;buy and dump&quot; fashion?<br><br>So why isn&#39;t supply meeting demand there, huh? Is it socialism again doing shady work? Or is it the markets failing to account for reasonable needs, favouring whatever stimulates our need for social recognition instead?<br><br>This is where libertarianism is blindsided. It acts as if we&#39;re reasonable, measured consumers. We&#39;re not, we can be engineered to buy anything, given enough investment for such engineering to work. Privately funded researchers just need to find out about any loophole in our biology/psychology and boom, marketers have new means of creating demand over goods and services that are secondary at best to our most important needs! Tell me, right in the eyes, that goddamn social attention addictions are expressions of objective and sane demands, that markets ought to satisfy with totally essential products such as Tik Tok and Twitter!<br><br>If we are to be so sure about the &quot;objective causality&quot; between what we want and buy and are compelled to buy, and what we actually need to be happy, then how the hell do hippies get along and happy with how bare and unorthodox their consuming habits are?<br><br>How do people willingly refuse to be part of market trends and still live happily?<br><br>Are there ghosts in Javier&#39;s machine?"

I go to work almost every day and what i see is huge rewards for business owners, top leadership, and investors, and small rewards for wage earners many of whom have large debts. I dont know what the answer is but, i dont see a bright future for the majority of the wage earners i work with. By all means, please explain to me how this will actually benefit people other than the already wealthy? This is not a complaint it is an actual question. I hear all these speeches by people on the left and right, pro and anti capitalism , pro this system anti that system and they all say the same thing. &quot;Our way will eliminate poverty and increase wealth.&quot; Well HOW? How will it increase my personal wages? How will it directly increase the income and standard of my friends and family?"

Look, I don&#39;t see how any system man has come up with could do that...mainly because any system always requires some number of people to make decisions and move money around, and power corrupts...but of the system tried, capitalism is definitely not one to end poverty...it creates it.  Money flows from the many who have little to the few who have much.  Companies have the power to manipulate local and even the federal government, getting tax breaks and kick backs and even bailouts.   Companies grow larger, snuff out smaller operations and bully small suppliers. They always look to maximize profits, sending jobs over seas.  Even on a local level, those with more than they need buy up properties to rent out, building their wealth while making the housing market a harder place for new buyers to find a home.  Everywhere you look, the desire...not to have what you need but to be wealthy...means that those who achieve success receive 10, 20 or 100s of times the income for the same amount of time worked.   Meanwhile, professions crucial for a society, teaching, police, doctors, firefighters and more are often under paid or there simply aren&#39;t enough.   Capitalism as an answer to poverty has to be one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever heard."

But I&#39;m going to guess that the overwhelming majority of people at the WEF are either directly state agents, or &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; who DON&#39;T as a primary economic model provide a service in a free market, but instead collect huge government contracts.   You can&#39;t have it both ways.  You can SAY you&#39;re libertarian, but if you build the very tools of coeresion and oppression that states use to take taxes from one group and steal resources from another, you&#39;re actually just a self serving, unprincipled scumbag.

It is the interconnecting of most economies of the world. In fact, to make it short, one tries to produce goods at places where it is the cheapest. Hence, the whole world serves as a common market where everyone is in competition against each other to provide the cheapest prices for goods, so that other international customers will choose to buy in your country.<br><br>But the fact is that the West pushed hard to establish for full-blown globalization because it would serve the West the most. And the West almost achieved it. Had there not be the fact that China and Russia rebelled after 2014 and decided to not follow the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù any longer, we would most likely sit in a fully globalized world nowadays. But China decided to establish its own vision of an NWO and globalization, and Russia as well. That led to major disruptions, after 2018, in the global supply chains and after the ‚ÄúCorona Years‚Äù to the death of the globalization.<br><br>Now take this into consideration. If the West had succeeded with its plan to divide Russia and gain access to all of Russia‚Äôs resources, China would have folded instantly. There have been four attempts to achieve this:<br><br>1) Napoleon.<br><br>2) Hitler.<br><br>3) Yeltsin, who enabled the Western effort to dismember Russia in the 1990s. The West tried that by inserting, training, and supplying Islamic terrorists in Russia‚Äôs Caucasus regions. This ongoing process was stopped and reverted when Vladimir Putin became President.<br><br>4) Ongoing efforts to turn around Russian allies located near Russia and to bring them into NATO. This involved terrorizing Russian populations in these former Soviet countries to a) induce Russia to attack them and b) to bring protest and conflict into Russia because of perceived weak Russian leadership. This would trigger large scale protests which would have been taken over as soon as success was in sight by pre-placed Western-trained puppet protest leaders. And then, doing again the same as was done with Yeltsin. Fighting bloody civil wars all across Russia and thereby making Russia fall apart.<br><br>That has been essentially the Western goal for at least 250 years. In fact, far longer, but my explanations started 250 years ago. If Russia and China folded or fell apart, the West would become the sole ruler over the whole world, since it would control almost all of the resources and markets and also be the unchallenged military power. This would usher in the New World Order, or the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù. Now you might assume that the United States would lead this new world order. That‚Äôs entirely wrong. Never forget, especially if you are an American: Your only role in this scheme is to provide the military force to achieve the creation of the NWO, and afterwards to act as some kind of police force, when individual countries (Libya? Yugoslavia? Syria? etc.) decide to not follow the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù (RBIO).<br><br>The Dynasties that control the finance system and the MIC, which are both hierarchically above the national governments, would use pre-established organizations to make themselves the undisputed rulers of some kind of world government. Which would have been the UN if Russia and China would have fallen."

Your country WILL NOT recover in 1 or two years time, because now you&#39;re poor, your land - stollen, your business - taken away, your spirit - broken. Most politicians that were part of the one and only party ruling over its nation will remain in politics forming different parties, some of them &quot;left-leaning&quot; other - &quot;right-leaning&quot; but it doesn&#39;t matter because now corruption is rampant and they&#39;ll take advantage of that. Police will become blind to gangs and mafia will take over. Infrastructure will crumble because the money for building roads and edifices will go in someone&#39;s pockets.

We have but to Observe and or, Study, the social welfare of nations which observed socialism and Communism. It is Madness, in how so many are being swayed,to go along with Socialism. Either,  Madness,or, plain ol Lazy and self entitled people. It is extremely obvious, in that the leftists have been destroying our current monetary system: covid, markets manipulations, creation of illegal immigration(with added incentive of free money/food/room n board and cell phones) all while laying off American workers ie., county workers,fed workers,social services, due to immigrant welfare.

@itscflow,2024-01-22 00:19:13+00:00,2024-01-22 00:26:18+00:00,0,The problem with capitalism is that it&#39;s a very self-serving system that creates a moral dillemma for government officials and corporations who are more concerned with profit than the well being of the public. Examples like lobbying for certain regulations or companies making products that are designed to fail so you have to repurchase them. Companies paying for information to spread or covered that prevent regulation in there industry because that would hurt profits regardless if those regulations would be better for the consumers. There are some major problems with capitalism and im eager to find solutions imagine we will have less problems as we advance we might be able to hold government&#39;s accountable and our ability to access more information on products and services should make it harder to be nefarious or self serving.

Also there is no way to hold the government accountable for how they spend our tax dollars or how they alter the monetary supply. Those are the main problems with capitalism, it promotes profiteering and instead of corporations maming products with consumers best interest they are making them as cheap as possible or not effective. Like the pharmaceutical industry for example. The quality of our food is diminishing as companies want to make things last longer and spray extra chemicals on everything despite health concers its all about maming money. It really does creat a moral dilemma on the flip side. Hopefully we can work these problems out of capitalism with our upcoming technologies that will keep people more informed quicker and can hold governments accountable for budgets international funding etc"

If I had a billion dollars, I would want to buy a home for every American, but the government wouldn&#39;t allow it without getting their cut. This is the problem with those who say we are free. You can go to work and be a slave so the government can take the majority of your earnings, but if you are one of the top 3% and have billions, our government condemns charity by severely punishing the wealthy for being humane. Everything is about control and power and greed, these people don&#39;t even comprehend what it means to be humane and have no comprehension of what Christianity is, yet constantly preach how Christian they are while people are freezing to death and dying from heat stroke because they are homeless and being exposed to the elements.

Powerful nations with a long history of industrial of industrial and social progress feel their foundations unstable. Men fear a crash that might wipe out in months the progress of centuries. Knowledge <br>skill,  scientific devices, productive capacity are at higher point than ever before, but some basic defects in the method of utilising these factors at this juncture in history prevent them from rendering their fruits to mankind and create a position full of menace. Millions of competent workers stand idle in the streets of New York, Berlin, London, Sydney and the plants and machinery and material for the handling of which posses the necessary skills lie unused and deteriorating. From early times man has dreamt of an age of plenty. Prophets have foretold the coming of  a Utopia where work would be light and the material needs of life would be satisfy with ease and abundance for all. When for the first time in history the conditions for the realization of this dream seams nearly in their grasp, instead of confidence and hope fear fills the minds of men.&quot; Jame Maxton British Socialist MP"

But beyond and above this particular instance we are in communion with Marxism in its purest form in the International, in other words with our religion, because it is the weapon of our nationalism, in turn defensive and offensive, buckler and sword.

He sounds like some of our former leader who wrote the US constitution which was based on Biblical principles. Our  fathers fled persecution from Europe from the union of  kings and papal powers that oppressed the people, the Dark Ages, to a better land to be govern by the people and for the people,  that is why USA prospered and was blessed. But now we are being deceived  by the prince of darkness and his evil agents  to control and take away our human rights . .<br>We are in the finals last and worst years of human history, climate change is not because of CO2 but signs of Christ&#39;s second coming to warn the people to prepare and not to be deceived,  read Matthew 24 and Revelation  chapters 13 The first beast is describing the Papacy and the second beast verse 11 is the USA.  To enforce the mark of the beast they must have central bank digital currency CBDC so you can not buy or sell. God&#39;s last message to world is found in Revelation 14:6-12.<br> &quot;There are but two powers that control the minds of men-the power of God and the power of Satan&quot; Signs of Times, June 29, 1891<br>‚ÄúMan is Satan&#39;s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. He has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan&#39;s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts.‚Äù Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 294.2<br>For more info. see videos from Amazing Facts Ministry. God bless"

It is the SAME angle that Capitalists have been shouting for decades.  But, economic numbers are NOT the whole picture.  We have to look at stress on our planet, in the form of never-ending-growth.  This is NATURE.  No single species can overly dominate a closed habitat (the Earth), for much length of time.  <br><br>For example: we keep over-fishing.  We have started fishing FARMS... but the quality isn&#39;t the same.  You can&#39;t expect salmon in a closed &quot;farm&quot;, eating CORN of all things will stay a healthy fish to eat.  Within a few short generations we&#39;ll have some weird, non-nutritious white fish that has nearly ZERO benefits to eat.  Might as well skip the process and just eat corn.  This is just ONE example of how un-tethered Capitalism goes WAY off the rails.  Analysts who stay stuck in the financial only number NEVER seem to consider the bigger picture.  <br><br>Now, I&#39;m not saying that brutal, authoritarian Communism is the answer.  It&#39;s not.  But, we need a NEW system.  We need a system that does NOT waste, yet rewards innovation for sustainability.  Like with Capitalism, it causes companies to make things that BREAK often.  Because then people need to buy more.  This is WHY Capitalism is NOT sustainable.  Because we&#39;re just throwing stuff away for the purpose of making profits &quot;LOOK&quot; good on paper for awhile longer.  But the longer it goes on, the more unrecoverable this crap will be.  <br><br>Also, none of these VERY FEW points get into major financial inequality.  We&#39;ve got a SHITLOAD of homelessness in the USA.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s even worse in many other countries.  That problem keeps getting WORSE, with cut-throat Capitalism.<br><br>Check out my handle/name... &quot;QUESTION EVERYTHING!&quot;  It&#39;s because platitudes in speeches can easily sway someone who doesn&#39;t quickly question the deeper and wider picture."

But what about the part about how the things being sold are contributing to the ruin of the earth? economic prosperity is still connected to producing nonessential products that pollute our water and end up in landfills. I What he‚Äôs saying makes sense from working within the current world system. And I don‚Äôt agree with collectivism as we see it today. But in America, 14 years ago our government created Citizens United. It gives corporations the same rights as American citizens and it‚Äôs the root of the wealth inequity we see today. Deregulation is not the answer. Libertarianism works on an individual level, but I don‚Äôt believe it will work on a governmental level. We must look beyond capitalism to solve the problems we face now. Capitalism is rooted in competition and production of goods. Both of which are killing the planet. They say that most jobs in the future will be done by machines. Where does that leave us? There is a huge global conflict looming between democratic nations and fascist communist together with Muslim nations. The stage is being set now by Xi and Putin. In the next 5 years they will try to bring democracy down. Democratic nations need to come together to protect the freedom that we have. The future will be won not by those who are morally superior, but by those who are strongly united in purpose. Democratic free nations cannot become divided over things like Palestine or Ukraine. We are coming into a time when we must come together with one voice and say no to facism. Regardless of what you think of the United States, we must come together to stand for democracy. Democratic first world nations need to work collectively and strategically to create a plan to fairly invest in infrastructure and jobs in developing nations."

However, crony unrestrained capitalism like USA from 1865-1945 and 1990-present was a boom and bust economy that saw the top 1-10% getting ridiculously wealthy and the middle class struggling;and the rates of poverty that holds back the growth and development of USA and every country. So, capitalism that works for all. He is partially wrong about wealth-so much is inherited and hoarded. Incentives were not destroyed from 1950-1980 in USA when top marginal (and progressive)tax rates were 70-90% and so many corporations and people became very wealthy and the middle class exploded. Does he mean that taxes should be voluntary? If so he is living in the same dream world as those who want communism ism and collectivism. He also misses that there is capitalism in USA especially for corporations when times are good but when about to fail there is socialism in bailouts and tax breaks that hurt communities because roads, bridges, water, sewer, schools etc. all depend on tax revenue.

They own all of the assets and companies,  power companies, railroads, and their next agenda is to own every property in the entire planet.

(Joseph, Peter. 2017.¬†The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing the Economy to End Oppression) The market economy is based on cyclical consumption and it really doesn‚Äôt matter what is being produced, how it is being produced, or why. If demand or production slows, so too does the movement of money, and when this happens, the economy contracts, systematically reducing the standard of living for many. Economically, this means capitalism is structurally oblivious to humanity‚Äôs existence on a finite planet. The system wants to produce, not conserve. In fact, if you think about it, you will discover an interesting paradox to market logic: the fact that¬†capitalism is a scarcity-based economic system that actually seeks infinite consumption <br><br>There are many more studies that contradict the well known propaganda are now accesible in the Web.

We need more people like this but the people behind the WEF will most likely not let this stand since he is in this lions den of socialists and neo communists. Calling them socialist and neo communists is not a complement. In fact it&#39;s a slam on their illegal take over of the world. They are illegally using a model of social engineering to control every person on this planet. The science they have created  and use is slowly moving everything and everyone to a bondage reality. Your country won&#39;t be in charge but will be under the WEF. Freedom is opposite of socialism and communism and government imposed laws. Freedom is personal responsibility for self, family and community in all areas of life. Socialists and neo communists do not take up responsibilities as adults should and only take handouts from a government. Those corrupt in power promote the idea of government dependence to grow the government to have greater control. Lazy people meet with free handouts from government equals more laws. The elite want more control over you. You are willing to give up freedoms to be lazy. This is no way to live. The US is at the tipping point of defaulting on its monetary system from all the billions of handouts! This is the plan of the elites involved with the WEF, which I turn are over your government and in your government. The US is no longer a democracy, people. We are going down fast into collective and personal bondage. What can we do? Start by getting rid of ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. This is often called sustainability. In a business context, sustainability is about the company&#39;s business model, i.e. how its products and services contribute to sustainable development. But it&#39;s not on an even playing field. ESG encompasses diversity and inclusion which is another socialist psyop. Social engineering is manipulation over us all. Be awake and not woke. I pray that this man lives and makes an impact against all of those in power that are plotting against you and I."

Meaning that when we double a value of gdp ( about 27 years needed with only 3% GDP annually) we also double energy usage. New energy only add to existing supply and never replace previous methods( coal is still used today as well as solar/wind power). That trend is exponential for both GDP and energy consumption, meaning that in couple of hundred years with ‚Äú only‚Äù 3 % annual growth we will need more energy than the sun, in a thousand years we would need something like the total energy of our galaxy and so on and so on‚Ä¶ NOBODY seems to understand and care/ think about the current situation with mathematical approach, and people could never understand the dynamic nature of exponential growth, this will kill not only us but also this planet.

You cannot have a fully free market because the owners will abuse the system as they are in my country where the state has put almost 0 restrictions regarding distribution of labor profits(wages). The wages are horrible. No laws to force the owners for annual increase, there are people with minimum wage for years at same company. And these people are many. The state must interfeer.

Argentina inflation was very high, indeed, before him, just in such a way to made the politic situation unstable, opening space to men like this one.

There cannot be a legal transaction to make you an owner. To become an owner you have to restrict the access of others to this ressource. This is only possible by violence.<br><br>So he practically says, that the only purpose of the state is to use violence to grant a few the ownership of everything and leave the rest of control to them.<br><br>This is a feudal state, where the property is owned by a few but being rent to the masses to do the production. The freedom of the few owners is the right, to substract from the production as much as they want because they set the price for renting the property.<br><br>But feudalism is not the same as capitalism. Feudal systems were stagnant economies. So what he describes is not a brilliant future but the end game of capitalism and the return to absolute poverty.<br><br>He blames the west, that it did turn to what he calls &quot;socialism&quot;. But this wasn&#39;t what did happen about 40-50 years ago. In the Reagan/Thatcher-era and later the West did turn just into this direction and became stagnant because rent extraction killed growth.<br><br>At about the same time a very government controlled country started to make use of capitalism: China.<br>The mixture of government control and capitalism created an economic boom outstanding in human history which did lift more people out of absolute poverty than ever in history.

Also factory farm animals endure lives of suffering because competition drives the more compassionate farmers out of business.  This kind of regulation is NOT collectivism.

Obviously they have no interest in creating policies that create wealth for everybody. Most of these proponents would have their own finger in the pie for a slice of the action.We are being currently turned into communists with ever increasing taxes from all around us so that more people have to rely on the state to redistribute the hard earned rewards of those that work the hardest. Call it what you will but in my books, it is called COMMUNISM BY STEALT. We need to look after the weak not turn everyone into slaves of the state. If the market system is left to work without the continued interference of the state, we would all be better off. Reduce the burden on the people not increase it. Reduce the waste not create more avenues for taxation and commissions which require more people shifting numbers instead of employing them to manufacture  products. <br>Good for you Argentina. You have the right person managing your country. You will be the best example for the rest of the world to follow."

@SkeeNnN,2024-01-21 13:09:08+00:00,2024-01-21 13:14:12+00:00,0,"Holy shit a prime minister capable of arguing intellectually sound (or at the very least interesting) ideas in a long speech format. He is miles ahead of his western colleagues in this regard. As a libertarian leaning guy I would certainly vote for him. I do however see some flaws in his argument particularly on abortion. Also other social aspects than economics have to be considered in legislation. I for example have a counterpoint to the The libertarian argument against redistributing wealth  &quot;as it hurts overall economic growth&quot;. While it&#39;s true in a vacuum redistributing wealth results in everyone just becoming less rich than they could have been as growth will slow down and the cake becomes smaller.  There is one interesting social aspect this economic idea ignores. And that is: it is well documented that as inequality increase so does crime. The causality can be argued, but psychologically it makes sense that those who are the least fortunate in life will always envy those who have more than them. If someone is working their ass of 10 hours a day on minimal wage and they see someone sitting on his chair making 10000x what you make doing basically nothing, then no amount of free market theory will hinder a deep feeling of inequality and potential anger. When enough people are affected by this anger they will riot and/or ellect radical pro government politicians and thus hurt the economy. Therefore it is my belief that there is a sweet spot where you redistribute just enough wealth so that people don&#39;t become angry but at the same time allow for economic growth to take place. I know this may be immoral according to pure libertarians but I think in the real world it is necessary as the end result will be more government either way.  A pure anarco capitalist society only works if everyone one understands and 100% agrees with its premise, otherwise it&#39;s doomed to fail as the plebians will inevitably rebel against the system."

The fantastic utopia this will lead to is 4 or 5 trillionaires and a few thousand multi billionaires are every one else (except a select few who wipe their rich masters with squares of raw silk when they use the bathroom) everyone else will need to fight for food.

This was not so clearly stated in his advocacy of Capitalism. We can observe how capitalism has kept till today many nations in poverty as in the Sahel region of Africa and other parts of the World by exploiting their ressources at the expense of these populations.

This speech is one of the best speeches by someone from the West and the South who spoke about real, genuine issues.  There are things that can be adjusted a bit.  There are various types of capitalism.  One of them is that the workers own the company 50% + one share.  So it can&#39;t just be broken and the rest goes to the owner.  Everything can be arranged, you just need to want to, and especially you need to know how.  But I don&#39;t have high expectations, because I know that most of us have no idea what the man was saying.  They don&#39;t even know what capitalism is.  And no, the social component is not evil.  People are evil, not systems.  Any system is good if properly implemented, of course, except for those destructive systems that are created only to destroy.  Capitalism is in reality a system of construction.  But some evil forces were not so pleased with the wealth of the USA, or the wealth of other countries.  They want everything for themselves, not for others.  0.30% of people hold the rest of 99.70% in their hands.  Which means it&#39;s not 1 percent."

Putting all the blame on &quot;socialism&quot; is an out-of-date left vs. right view.  Monopolization and corrupt practices of lobbyist and venture capitalism are out greatest dangers.  The state in many countries has become a tool of cartel-ism on the part of the biggest &quot;capitalist&quot; empires.  As such, the real problem is not the &quot;system&quot;, it&#39;s the corruption and dishonesty of it&#39;s members.  Look at the most successful and fair economies in the world. They are based on fairness and honest, sensible government in co-operation with capitalism.  I won&#39;t list the countries that are seen as the best and fairest in the world.  Any absolutist long-term undemocratic regime will become corrupt and this does not depend on capitalism or socialism.  Lack of honesty in both government and modern venture, shareholder focused oligopolization is what needs to be tackled. Yes to freedom and true open markets, but also to a right to provision of the basic needs of all human beings.  Once upon a time universal literacy was a pipe-dream.  What system made it a reality?  We can do this for all other fundamental needs we decide to include as a basic right for every human on the planet."

Like in Poland, Czechia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Croatia... I am sure Chile, Uruguay and maybe even Panama are doing very good. But most of the others in Latin America need help to push their economies towards the MUCH better numbers per Capita towards the first world status. I mean Slovenia, Czechia, Lithuania, Estonia, now got SUPER HIGH GDP PPP per capita. Similar level like Japan or the UK! All because of the EU unity. Same thing happened to Puerto Rico cause of the unity with the USA. Puerto Rico now got GDP per capita like the first world country! All because it joined the United States of America.

Like a peach, there is a big seed and around it there is sweet flesh. The sweet flesh is free capitalism, where restaurants compete with each other and people pay lots for luxuries and travels. But then there is a seed, and this seed is citizen salary, where every citizen is paid each month enough currency to sustain food, house and local transport. <br><br>We should not waste tax money to investigate if people are worth food and houseing, we should not spend money to see if someone is poor enough to get help, we should all get citizen salary, and only encourage people into the capital system with its sweet fruit flesh as a reward. So essentially there is a world for exteme socialism and capitalism to work hand in hand with each other, not against each other, giving us a productive fruit, just like the peach, where the seed is not forgotten. We all agree that all people should have the right to basic needs, so why dont we implement a system that gives that instead of policing the citizens?"

@Firelech,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,0,"There is nothing new in this speech because it is a standard, intellectually barren, demagogic, self serving, faulty justification of a system of social production that relies on the physical and intellectual labour of the vast majority to produce goods, advance the productive forces through technology, mitigate problematic environmental outcomes, reproduce, educate and sustain the labour force, sustain health, protect the weak and elderly, provide necessary but unprofitable infrastructure, etc.  that system is capitalism, whether it‚Äôs slightly modified by humanitarian concerns such as public healthcare for example or whether it it‚Äôs closer to (in reality never extant) his more sociopathic ideal of totalitarian free market capitalism.  In contrast to the social nature of production, capitalism places command of production and allocation of its product in individual hands.  The social production is therefore directed and used for the selfish accumulation of vast social wealth in private hands, far beyond any rational accounting of the contribution of that class of people.  Anyone remotely acquainted with historical development understands that capitalism was a dynamic force for social development because it better suited social production than the decaying feudal system that came before it.  Capitalism is not freedom from the state.  It has always relied on state enforcement, coercion of society into conforming with the control and embezzlement of socially produced wealth.  It is well known that the state itself arose as a means to enforce private control of social wealth.  That is exactly what it did when it smashed and enslaved free societies of the indigenous across the globe during colonialism.  His main premise that socialism is repugnant to freedom because it entails enforcement of distribution of social wealth into social hands is nonsense because capitalism itself depends on state coercion, always.  Capitalism always relies on the state to also allocate whatever share of resources remain in public hands to facilitate private enrichment opportunities.  Clearly he resents the fact that the majority of society have managed to influence the state to some degree to provide some improvement of conditions for the producing masses.  The governments he is attacking are completely capitalist governments but mitigated by social gains won in struggle by the producing class.  To large degree they were able to do that due to the competing example of actual socialist governments.  Capitalists always rely on social welfare and only improve societal conditions when forced to by the masses in political struggle.  Argentina has been held back by what is now quite obviously an outdated irrational and harmful system of production and wealth allocation.  As an extremist and a fantasist he blames disarray on the sporadic ability of the producing masses to win some social concessions through the state whereas in fact the development of the economy is held back by the self serving sociopathic capitalist class that maintains fundamental control over the state and therefore its protection of their parasitic enrichment that is simply enforced diversion of social wealth to private hands.  His resentment of women‚Äôs reproductive choice and environmental management are a blatantly selfish fantasy relating to the social position he and his class are in.  Their greedy state enforced position is reflected in his moral fantasy that it somehow represents the essence of man.  The decay of western capitalism is exemplified in the social decay, hampered productivity, bloated scale of non productive financial swindles and general decline we see in the US as its empire crumbles.  Whereas countries such as China use elements of capitalism that still play a role in developing social production within overarching social control of social production and wealth distribution that is protected by the state.  His rule in Argentina will enrich his class while snatching back concessions.  It will cause chaos and resentment until it falls in disarray to those who will attempt to repair the damage."

We are surrounded by monopolies more people have died and suffered as a result of this ideology.  We pay more for less of a service. All utilities,  communications,  airline, mining should remain the property of the people. You are free to make your money any other way. Recognising business is not a living entity, should pay taxes, and face laws that are an actual deterrent. Capitalism fails when it can&#39;t steal the resources of other countries.  What country&#39;s still has a democracy?"

My parents and grandparents were working class and never in their lives worked more than 40 hours a week and had 1 full month paid vacation. The education was free and one of the best in the world. On top of that every citizen received an apartment in the city and a lot of land in the countryside to build a homestead FOR FREE from the government. People never paid a dime for their housing because it was FREE! Right now I am living in the &#39;richest&#39; free market economy in the world (USA) and I have to work 60-70 hours a week just to pay the rent and can&#39;t even save up for the downpayment to get a mortgage which I will have to pay for 30 years. How come communism/socialism was bad ???

Also we cannot continue to grow on a forever linear path because there are limited resources, eventually markets plateau when resources run out, and that will cause an implosion of capitalism, and a collapse of civilization. Capitalism requires never ending resources and continual linear growth. Socialism is the end result of late stage capitalism, when the system starts failing as capitalism is unsustainable. Only way to overcome the unsustainability factor is to harvest vast resources via our solar system through significant investment/advancements in AI and space travel. Go Elon Musk. Also we need fusion power. Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking these elites are anti-capitalists, they are not. They are merely implementing &quot;solutions&quot; to the problem of late stage capitalism as they are able to observe the cliff the system is heading towards.  Basically they have benefited from capitalism and are trying to make it sustainable by causing controlled decline, centralizing the economy, and decreasing population growth so that they can hold onto their wealth and resources. The masses are using up too many resources and are too hard to control, so they need decline not growth. The general population can&#39;t see the cliff because they aren&#39;t heavily involved in macroeconomics, and therefore don&#39;t understand the elitist agenda. the Elites are pro-capitalists, but anti-democratic. They want us to be collectivistic and socialist, but for them it&#39;s full blown oligarchic/technocratic capitalism, because that is what benefits them the most. There really isn&#39;t an argument of capitalism vs socialism."

Oh, the freedom of giving up your own currency! Because nothing says &#39;we&#39;ve lost our way&#39; quite like clinging to a foreign power&#39;s coattails. It‚Äôs not freedom; it&#39;s a fire sale of national sovereignty. Imagine, a country&#39;s economic leash held by another nation&#39;s central bank. Independence? More like dependence with extra steps.<br><br>And about this sell-off of national assets ‚Äì it&#39;s not just a yard sale, it&#39;s a desperation move. They‚Äôre not just selling off assets; they‚Äôre practically giving them away in a time of crisis. It&#39;s Economics 101: You sell when the market‚Äôs booming, not when it‚Äôs glooming. But here they are, unloading valuable assets at rock-bottom prices. It&#39;s like hosting a bargain basement sale for your most prized possessions. The buyers are skipping with glee, snatching up bargains, while the country‚Äôs left holding an empty bag.<br><br>In this grand scheme of ‚Äòeconomic revival,‚Äô Argentina isn&#39;t striking a great deal. It&#39;s being cornered into a discount deal, where the real winners are the ones holding the foreign currency and snapping up assets. So, when they talk about &#39;radical economic reform,&#39; they&#39;re not setting sail for prosperous shores; they‚Äôre drifting towards an economic iceberg, and all they&#39;ve got is a ‚ÄòFor Sale‚Äô sign to patch the holes."

It was the tireless efforts of laborers, reformers, and activists through strikes, protests, and political movements that eventually forced improvements in wages, working conditions, and access to education and healthcare. Without these struggles, the benefits of the Industrial Revolution would likely have remained concentrated in the hands of the wealthy elite, leaving the majority worse off.<br>He says that the world is ruined because of socialism, and that the world is better today thanks to capitalism (he didn&#39;t say anything about global warming, no wonder). it sounds like two different realities of same world...He makes free market capitalism and libertarianism sound like the perfect formula to redeem humanity (it sounds like a comercial) from all its evils. No matter how much we wish to believe that there is a simple and infallible formula to solve all our problems, the reality is a lot more complex than that. Some so called leaders keep speaking to the peoples of the world as if they have a cristal clear understanding of our problems and that they have the divine strategy to make us all prosperous and happy, while the gap between rich and poor keeps growing... A republic wthout a state is liike a car whitout enging nor steering wheel rolling downhills... The problem is not the state or the simplified formula we call socialism but the people who govern... There&#39;s nothing wrong with doing business, it&#39;s how you do it what makes the difference, anyway.

Where would the ‚Äúmarket freedom‚Äù come from if not from some authoritarian institutions? It follows that we need the &quot;free enterprise&quot; bankers and the free global corporations to assert their monopolies as the freedom to exploit the third-world population. Hence, Orwellian doublethink is offered as the solution: we should assert social control to deny social control while happily enslaved in the name of market &quot;freedom&quot;. We should oppose ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù in the name of ‚Äúfree market capitalism‚Äù which is nothing but a new form of feudalism. And all this at the time the parasitic global corporations desperately need the imperial government&#39;s protection to survive and continue to exploit his country‚Äôs population.

The scenario does not have to be real and the conclusions can be disconnected and false. Through out the period mentioned the entire world did not have capitalism.

Their punishments were slaps on the wrist, even when caught in the act.<br>Bell Telecom did likewise.<br>Fuel companies do likewise.<br><br>Sure, some get outed and fail, like Enron, but the rarity of those few against the larger businesses is fractionally small.<br><br>It was not through lack of insight and awesomeness that people like Nikola Tesla could not out-perform and put his ideals on cheaper and cleaner energy into the market of early America. And it is still much the same. Even those with ground breaking sciences and chances to better economic ideals for our societies are ground under the heel of huge conglomerates and businesses eager to lose no footing on profit and who care not-at-all for any of us, so long as money is to be made. More over, most governments would bend over backwards for the continuance of these huge companies, not because it is right, but because ties, contacts, deals, and assured(even if reduced) tax flows pour in from them. A system built on money and profit, dies the same as any other. It&#39;s virtues are likewise it&#39;s vices and eventual downfalls. <br><br>Profiteering and capitalism is no cure.<br><br>Privateering died out ages ago. Modern pirates just wear suits and have fancy contractual agreements deep in legal-ese rather than swords and eye patches- and they steal considerably more from all of us respectively."

Selfish behavior that is twisted towards the greater good often results in better outcomes and better behavior for those that you were going to be altruistic towards. Capital growth speeds up the rate of resource extraction and that is burning a candle at more than two ends. The competition for capital creates most of the evils of the world. So it&#39;s not an easy one sided consideration. It would be nice if we could openly state what the real base currency is, but that is &quot;inhumane&quot; by many people&#39;s standards.

Capitalism without safeguards to ensure individual rights to basic sustainability has sometimes run amuck in the west.  And so we a large percentage of homeless people who can&#39;t afford rent while the most profitable corporations like Amazon pay no taxes for what individuals cannot provide for themselves, e g. Firefighting, schools, medical systems.  Mille is supporting a world where an individual can&#39;t tell a big company not to pollute or not to price gouge if it can and that is the downside of capitalism that must be regulated.  That has nothing to do with socialism.  That has to do with prevention of corporate fascism or dictatorship by the rich over the poor."

The issue is when capitalism evolves into corporate domination, where there is no competition, and the corporations put us under a collectivism system so they don‚Äôt have to ever worry about up-and-coming competition.

The only reason why we are so deprived is because we kept acting on our human right to freely dispose of our wealth. The government is a body of humans, it takes more senseless humans to come along and throw away natural wealth and inalienable human rights for more artificial wealth with rights and duties of a coproration aka person. Protecting human rights and standing up for values does not mean we become deprived of modern advances. Know though that ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY. This is an ouroboros.

If this person was a true Libertarian he would not agree with any form of government or nationalism. True Libertarians are globalist free market ideologues. This notion comes out of Halibury college via Adam Smith. Halibury was the college of the  British east India company. Looters and plunderes of the globe. It&#39;s curious that the end goal of both Communism and Libertarianism is the dissolution of the state itself. Neither have ever produced this so called utopia. We do not have true Capitalism,  we have croney Capitalism which is a form of fascism in which mega corporations have gone into business with the government in order to eliminate competition.  This was accomplished by the late 1800s. We need antimonopoly enforcement to enable Capitalism to function as intended.

What puzzles me is that China has had the fastest growing economy the world has ever seen, and they are a blend of capitalism and socialist state supported industries. Their banks are owned by the government and unlike USA where private investors get a piece of all the money originating from the FED well in China the government since it isn&#39;t private Invester based can even write off bad loans and does that on a lot of failed businesses. However more new businesses actually work out that the ones that don&#39;t. Their formula incubates in the end a heck of lot of winners. I have been for over 40 years starting and running my own businesses. I understand the value of having a personal stake in what you do and have even gone belly up several times and had to start over. It is just that believing government is the problem well it doesn&#39;t match the Chinese example of unparalleled success. They are now the 2nd biggest economy in the world and may take America in a decade or so another weird fact is China is the number one trader with Argentina and how will he not deal with communist with this fact?"

Many people do not want to change because many of them have privileges or are indoctrinated by the previous socialist government. This will be a tough battle to change the socialist mentality of the people. My message to the people of the United States or Western countries is not to believe in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcollectivism/socialism, these policies may seem nice but the moment they are implemented they start to ruin the country little by little, causing poverty, low salaries and the quality of life is much worse, theft, deterioration of education, the Argentine case is evidence.

Government regulation.<br>Libertarianism is a minority position in politics and economics as the reality of Capitalism is profits.  That is it.  If a company does not make profits, people divest their funds.  <br>Traditional Capitalism does not recognize that Labor is Capital.  Those workers, their ability to produce goods, are what converts raw materials into salable products.

ANY economical or political system on their hands will become this perverted version of a &quot;free&quot; society.<br>Milei clearly doesn&#39;t undestand this as one of his primary goals was to make Argentina dependent on the american dollar, which is controlled by the same people he is criticizing here. Nor does most of the commenters on this video, thinking he is somehow fighting globalism by defending free market capitalism."

I contend he doesn&#39;t know what a right is and where it comes from. A right is a &quot;defended&quot; claim. Claim anything you want. Without a defense of your claim you enjoy no right. And who/what is the biggest defense of claims worldwide? It is government. And what is the biggest parasite worldwide? It is government. Go figure.

This is basically the Reagan mantra &quot;Government is not the solution. It is the problem&quot;. I am sure a lot of simpletons will cheer at these simplistic statements. Well then why didn&#39;t they just dissolve the state or government, then problem solved! And where are the &quot;90% people&quot; lifted out from poverty? The biggest was in China for the past decade. Without that the world poverty would have been increased. This is the nonsense without nuances. Of course capitalism contributed significant to the growth of world economy. However unrestricted it will also bring a dog-eat-dog society. That is why we need law and order, which is why we have governments, but not bad governments headed by idiotic or ignorant leaders. We need good governments headed by smart, competent, leaders who are also operating under checks and balance. It is just a matter on how the leaders are selected, and what kinds of checks and balance mechanism is applied. This mechanism also should be well-balanced, to achieve long term benefits for the people. But I will keep an open mind to see how Mr. Milei&#39;s experiment will work out. I am deeply skeptical, because he is the head of the state yet he believes the state is the problem. He already shut down many government agencies, so I guess the next will the rest, including the Defense Department, and then the office of the President? But hey, so many people here approve and cheer for him, so let&#39;s see."

Completely opposite to the canadian prime minister who has suckled onto the wefs agenda. In a pathetic spinless example of<br>A sell out to the seat of power he was entrusted with. <br>Realuze this war has not been fought and the wef will try to make the west assume there is nothing we can do since theyve corrupted the leadership. The fact of the matter is that we the people should prosecute these individuals<br>To the full extent and make a big example of them and let it stand as a deterrent for any other individuals or groups who think they can throw there weight around. And override democracy and the countrymen and the soviergnty which is already established. <br>The death penalty would be an appropriate deterrent especially in countries were the citizens can be drafted to fight for the country . The elected officials who betray the countrymans trust are guilty of the highest crimes in the land and should be served the most severe penalty. <br>Or this will continue until all which we cherish is gone. <br>Its already happening in countries where the people have been defanged and declawed. Like canada. Taje a good looj at what has occured in canada and you will see what agendas they have high hopes to implement in america as well. .<br>The government needs to porve to the people that this will be foyght against tooth fang and claw.

Diplomats.<br>Or trust fund babies from the stock market wealth . What is elite abput that. Absolutely nothing. . <br>We have no obligation to follow the lead of an unelected body on soveign land. Periof nor should are elected officials be permitted to ink any such deal and if new world order the wef and the w.h.o  is<br>Operation under the guise of n.a.t.o   then allegiances need to be reconsidered immediately. <br>Or it should be viewed as an act of war.

Are we in humanity grown in our consciousness enough that we can somehow get a handle on other types of corruption, as in human slavery, trafficking, inhumane working conditions etc.  I get it that there will always be selfish people with no conscience but will the majority of humanity find a way of dealing with this that doesn‚Äôt take away everyone‚Äôs freedom. People slip and slide and cut corners on all sorts of things. To do the right thing has to be in an individual‚Äôs heart. The consciousness of humanity needs a serious elevation. Good work on this speech, may we all be blessed with freedom and love for our people and this planet."

Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into <b>VRI TOKEN</b> Its more profitable."

Different models and parameters are used by different industries but <b>VRI TOKEN</b> info is pretty much universal. If you&#39;re trying to max your credit scores, there is a happy medium between too many credit cards and none. Too many cards with zero balnce may actually hurt you in some cases. Even if you do not use them, you have a potential. To always pay cash &amp; still have cards doesn&#39;t help your scores as well"

Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it&#39;s backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn&#39;t want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile. I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events, not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying, etc. There&#39;s a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like <b>VRI TOKEN</b> but there&#39;s probably a long way until a platform exists for it."

In France, they determine if you are eligible to get a loan (e.g., to buy a house) based on the ratio between your salary, your expenses and your savings. Basically, if every month you &#39;burn&#39; all your money, you&#39;re perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account. I feel in the US people tend to buy things they don&#39;t need with money they don&#39;t have... The only times I feel one should need a credit is when buying &#39;big&#39; things (house, car, etc.).

They are not binary as one is based on the other. <br><br>He has condensed 400 years of complete human civic transformation to a simple cause... Capitalism. Failing to discuss or mention the 10&#39;000 years of intellectual development and human story from the globes population that eventaully brought about the industrial revolution and global human awareness. The population growth and rapid decline from several global wars, the expansionism and wiping out of cultures (there is a reason they speak spanish in Argentina). <br><br>Free market rhetoric is fine, right up until your water suppliers are competing for prices and the cost of filtering water goes through the roof, they cut costs by dumping sewage illagally and the government can do nothing because they are lobbied by the &#39;free market&#39; or train lines compete on prices killing public transport and triggering rail strikes or the health system becomes privatised and the delays of transition kill 10s of thousands of patients, or eventually the cost of your treatment becomes dictated by an algorithm maintained by the best insurance providers! <br>Homes become a means of wealth rather then a place to sleep and make life and meritocratic mentalities leave those who cant keep up behind. <br><br>Dont fall into the hell hole that the UK has gotten itself in, (i am british) we are the 6th largest economy in the world and yet we&#39;ve never had so many homeless dying in the winter, our population has mass sickness and young people commiting suicide is the primary assumption for their death under the age of 30. Nothing works and our capital hosts some of richest individuals in the western hemisphere. We are one of the most unequal societies in Europe BECAUSE our attempts at making a nation ran by free market economics.<br><br>It all needs continuous re-assesment, the way we live. While i agree on his comments on peace, he sounds as endoctrinating as a soviet spokesman i.e. there is one system that works and here is the proof. This is not how life works we all know this, i believe we can leave a good world for our children but it takes recognising its variance first. <br><br>The rush toward capitalism as salvation is what stops me in my tracks and raises alarm bells. Some of his comments are at least forthright and clear and not filled with the trigger words of European politicians. Perhaps this is right but we in the UK have lived this game a long time and the ideas that people stand by and believe in like the NHS and working laws, health and safety ect none of them were spawned by free market capitalist or entrepreneurs. They were developed in spite of them. <br><br>We have had this rhetoric since the 1800s in the UK and if the people speaking it had their way our mothers would be working right up until they gave birth and not long after and half the population wouldnt have a vote."

Collusion, lack of competition through mergers and takeovers, bribes, artificial and real costs to entry distort the market.  Without proper regulation captialisim is in danger of reverting to aristocracy or oligarchy which will result in poverty for many.  Tax havens and economic structures that provide unfair advantage to some also damage the economic growth.  Argentina is not a good example due to the corruption in its elites.  One could argue that narco states are truely captialist - is that good for society?  Tell the whole story - not just what you want to see."

Let&#39;s get back to &quot;no handouts&quot;, working for what you need and want , providing quality goods and services for a modest price. The welfare system made socialism look desirable because (welfare/socialism) you can do bare minimum yet you get the same things and amounts as everyone gets. They fail to realized that (wel/social) means the govt owns you. There will be no Nike sneakers for the average citizen,  you will wear &quot;buddies&quot; like jail shoes, have the same clothing,  sleep on itchy sheets. You will stand in line, where and when they tell you to for your weekly bread, milk, cheese and maybe a meat.  There will be no handouts in socialism.

Of course capitalism, or free market economics, works best when people have the choice of whether they should buy something or not. It starts to break down when services are essential for survival and people have to buy. Governments can try and enforce competition in such circumstances. However governments are too easy to corrupt. There is also a temptation to impose price controls which is always a bad idea."
@WorkInLight,2024-01-20 10:43:49+00:00,2024-01-20 10:43:49+00:00,0,"The same people that have always had the wealth in the past, have the wealth now, they will never relinquish their power and the type of politics doesn&#39;t matter, they control dictatorships and so called democracies alike.  The issue is that the wealthy take advantage of all below them, whether we have a better quality of life than someone else from somewhere else, or another time, we certainly have gone backwards in recent times. It could be communism or capitalism, we are effectively slaves either way,  just with different comfort levels due to different rewards. And with those rewards comes tax, so they take it back from us, and mortgages where banks drive the market and inflation. The same people are behind either government, they don&#39;t care how they run the prison/asylum, as long as it works for them. We, the people, the masses, should be demanding fairness in whatever system you think we need, we don&#39;t need anything they offer as we need to control our own lives, our own households, our own communities, our own businesses, our own finances, our countries. There is a way out, but people have to realise what it is we are already in before that can happen."

Free-market capitalism (without monopolies or government interference) brings prosperity and freedom. Socialism, where the state (which has a monopoly on violence) raises taxes from the people and  uses them to control the people, brings poverty and slavery. History has proven this over and over again.  Feudalism, which obtained throughout the world for millenia, is essentially the same as Socialism, which is why the old-money elites promote socialism. Lenin and Trotsky were funded by Wall Street and the Bank of England. The same so-called aristocrats funded Mao in China and Pol Pot in Cambodia.  Today, the central banking cabal, which controls the money supply in 170 countries, promotes socialism because their owners are would-be aristocrats who want depopulation, global control and a return to the good old days of masters and slaves."

@luked2982,2024-01-20 06:51:57+00:00,2024-01-20 06:51:57+00:00,1,"He says there are no market failures. It depends what he means by market failures. Some people say things like, it was a failure of the market to deal with such and such a social issue. For example, if someone is born without property in a country where education is not free, then the market will not be a successful medium to guarantee equality of opportunity (not outcome). And, of course, the problem with capitalism as a historical system is that it evolved out of the aristocratic relations of Europe, wherein a segment of the population began from year 1 with great swathes of property, and others were simultaneously disenfranchised through enclosure and sent to factories where the wages were not enough to build up any stable capital. If you continue forward through that story, democracy was only achieved at the beginning of the 20th century, after which time there were two catastrophic wars which reduced most of the continent to poverty, and they have only been climbing out of that state since. Contrary to what president Milei says, standard of living has been dropping in the West since the 1970s when calculated by purchasing power of the general population.<br><br>I did not write the above to advocate socialism or to claim that I have &quot;debunked&quot; the above speech, but only to point out a problem. I do not understand why many in this comment section see this speech as being radical, since it represents the ideas of the political mainstream since at least the 1980s. Every western country operates on a capitalist basis, even the social democratic ones which are not run through government planning but only differ through higher tax regimes and government spending, not in the operation of the market which are all open to competition, and there are no countries with completely unregulated markets and I doubt there ever will be because that would mean, among other things, allowing poisons into everyday products."

Irrespective of what political system, unless you are america that issues US dollar, if a counry like argentia consistently have higher government spending than tax revenue, and must print more money to pay off international debt that result in very high inflation for decades and consistently default its own debt,  then your country would be dysfunctional.  <br><br>   it s like blaming economic mismanagement of Argentina  to democracy because voters want to keep government subsides and keep electing politicians that overspend and default its debt. <br><br>socialist China uses capitalism to list its own state-owned enterprises to market, local governments hired venture capitalists to invest and use investment gains to subsidise health care and education.  Socialism works when a country is spending within its means, and it uses capitalism as a tool to raise more tax revenue, not overspend or borrow just to win elections."

Most were not part of it. The huge difference is the creation of Democracy where all people could be part of the capitalist system and regulation so those that have most power cannot abuse those with no power. <br>I think it was Henry Ford said that &quot;my workers should earn enough to be able to by my product&quot;... this contributed more than anything to the economical uprise of the american economy. Before that the vast majority were so poor that ot was not sure if they could eat every day - in a capital system.

At some point the fix it man, the antichrist, will come in and give the appearance of rescuing the world. It&#39;s all a lie. The antichrist will demand you worship him as god.

@katherinekelly6432,2024-01-20 03:11:17+00:00,2024-01-20 03:11:17+00:00,1,"The United States has moved deep into socialism by deeming certain groups &quot;A Protected Class&quot; at the expense of other groups. This &quot;Protected Class&quot; claiming oppression is &quot;Above The Law&quot; where others are ruled by it. They use this advantage to avoid being responsible and through Lawyers , extort money and destroy the reputations of others. America is not moving toward socialism, it is moving toward totalitarian authority who acquires power by claiming the need to protect groups of people based on superficial characteristics and a past history. If America does not return to equal justice for all it is doomed as a country."

Some in capitalism get stupid rich. But this wealth is not enough. They look around and see that the masses have escaped poverty and now have money. The wealthy covet this wealth and push governments to change policies so they can gain the property of the masses. Socialism is the way they choose to make the masses poor and enrich themselves. Thus we have the WEF (stupid rich) who never have enough.

@spydude38,2024-01-20 00:07:14+00:00,2024-01-20 00:07:14+00:00,2,"Milei spoke of the &quot;Life, Liberty, and Property&quot;. First penned by British Philosopher John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, they were used to defend the claim that all men are free and possess the inalienable right to Life, Liberty and Property independent from the laws of any specific society. This was part of the foundation Locke used to describe where the people under a social contract willingly transfer some of their fights to government in order to better enjoy the stable enjoyment of their Lives, Liberty and Property. Meaning, that under this social contract, the government exists with the consent of the governed to protect the rights of people and that governments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced by the people. Thomas Jefferson who respected Locke replaced the word &quot;Property&quot; with &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which he likely borrowed from Locke again who wrote in a 1690 essay titled, &quot;Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, &quot;The pursuit of happiness is the foundation of Liberty&quot;. These words became part of the United States of America&#39;s Declaration of Independence."

And because they have accumulated so many different products and for many years undercut everyone else, there is now nowhere else to go to buy some products at sensible prices. Often bespoke places are 2-3x more expensive. Which means it&#39;s harder for individuals to change the market by voting with our wallets.<br><br>Also these supermarkets never pay their suppliers/farmers a good price, and have more and started to replace popular brands with their own brands, and they push up the price of the popular brands and then supply an inferior product at the old price of the popular brand.<br><br>Eventually all of those popular brands will stop doing business and the quality of the food will continue to degrade until there is absolutely no nutritional value left.<br><br>Why?

The American System is not Capitalism, but it is instead the free trade market system. The world was lifted out of poverty due to the Industrial Revolution, contrary to what people say, when they falsely attribute it to capitalism. Capitalism utilizes Usury which is criminal interest rates, also known as compound interest. We don&#39;t need Capitalism/Compound Interest Usury in order to have a functional free trade market system. We can create money at 0% interest, as the Christian Doctrine has dictated, and uplift the entire world out of poverty alongside the Industrialization."

Only the government can enforce competition and failing to do so will allow the haves via their ownership of monopoly stocks to get an ever-increasing share of the economy at the expense of the have nots. Eventually, the have nots are economically squeezed to the point where they follow a demagogue and democracy along with human rights comes to an end. <br><br>We are presently facing this abyss in the 2024 election."

It was the enslavement of fossil fuels and the rise of colonialism that triggered growth. The capitalists have a convenient correlation to justify their claim for credit. And how do they explain the obvious problem of the boundary condition of a finite planet consuming exponentially. Impossible.

The financial system act more like feudalism, growing without producing anything without contributing anything, only accumulating wealth that should otherwise circulate through real capitalism, ever gaining power by using power over other people.<br>The deregulation of the financial system has essentially killed the good effects of capitalism. The classic capitalism idea did not include financial systems running wild like they are, and the classic capitalism thinkers did not condone an unregulated financial system, only unregulated capitalism in the productive form.<br><br>So color me sceptic every time I hear someone praise capitalism, and then I wan&#39;t to ask ... what exactly do you mean by capitalism ?<br>One of the greatest and ignore problems in this world is the out of control financial system that has grown so big that capitalism, socialism, whatever ism doesn&#39;t really matter anymore - Only by addressing the problem of the financial system and the wealth accumulation by contributing nothing, can capitalism begin to work again.<br><br>The World Enslavement Forum agendas are very similar to feudalism, their member are the modern versions or Lords and normal people will be the serfs - Very much not capilism, but also no socialism (they only use socialism as a disguise)."

Iff this continues the world will be run by a few unelected  elites who will have all the power and we the people&#39;s of the free world will lose everything and basically become serfs to those elites. All free  peaple should  look at all the the freedoms we lost and all the lies and sensorship world wide that promoted a narrative   that these globalists demand and  with all the new data and real life data about the covid disaster   it shows how much hardship to the common person cam be coused by a group of peaple with a agenda.  Remeber. Socilism only works untill they run out of money to steel then it turns into a dictatorship and the peaple pay the price.
@LouisMaxBlank,2024-01-19 22:41:41+00:00,2024-01-19 22:41:41+00:00,2,"David Icke comments on the Mikei speech:<br><br>I heard that Milei&#39;s speech at the WEF champions freedom, so I listened. It doesn&#39;t. It seeks to move power and control from governments to corporations if you listen carefully and that‚Äôs happening anyway. What he doesn‚Äôt say is that governments and corporations are owned by the same global Cult. So either way the same cabal is in control.<br>The obsession with economic growth for its own sake is classic free-for-all, child-like economics, in which the strongest, most wealthy and powerful, prevail without the most basic checks and balances.<br>Economic growth is merely the amount of money spent on goods and services. So all the negative things that we don‚Äôt want to happen are ticked as positive by economic growth if money changes hands and profits are made.<br>‚ÄòFreedom‚Äô to be exploited by billionaires without redress is NOT freedom. Corporate monopolies with unchecked power is NOT freedom.<br>He talks about ‚Äòcapitalism‚Äô, but what he is describing in truth is cartelism.<br>It‚Äôs barely one-dimensional. It‚Äôs the playground. You challenge white with black and black with white while the Cult sits laughing in the shades of grey controlling both.<br>Milei is a child in a grown-ups‚Äô playground appearing to challenge power while handing it over to the already super-powerful. Which do you want? The ‚Äòfree‚Äô (rigged) market tyranny run riot or state-dictated communist tyranny?<br>Neither, thanks. I‚Äôm an adult. I want freedom and justice for all, not the few, and whether it‚Äôs Milei or Schwab the few get the spoils and the rest get the crumbs and the tyranny."

@funkyphilk,2024-01-19 22:32:31+00:00,2024-01-19 22:32:31+00:00,1,"Sadly, capitalism has probably killed even more than 100s of millions. Don‚Äôt forget that there are people who grow more wealthy through supporting the selling of weapons to both sides of a conflict, whilst others deliberately rush to sink their money into defence stocks whenever a new war breaks out. The sad truth is this: capitalism thrives on the misfortunes of others and yet collectivism allows fewer to have wealth, but generally does not aid and abet the killing of others. Capitalist freedom vs Socialist servitude. Wealth is not the answer- freedom to live in unity with your brother / sister is the thing to aim for, surely? Also, there is much folly in assuming that GDP growth is real wealth growth. Don‚Äôt forget the effects of inflation and the increasing wealth inequality. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, no matter the political system. Just think back 10 years - sure you may have more money now, but is it worth as much as it once was?"

@Neversettle0o,2024-01-19 22:00:05+00:00,2024-01-19 22:00:05+00:00,0,The amount of bots in the comments is remarkable.
@Whoisemmanuel,2024-01-19 21:59:54+00:00,2024-01-19 21:59:54+00:00,0,"While the speech compellingly outlines the successes of capitalism, particularly in driving economic growth and reducing global poverty, it&#39;s crucial to also recognize the system&#39;s limitations and the potential consequences of unregulated capitalism. Indeed, capitalism has been a powerful engine for innovation and wealth creation, but its unchecked form can lead to significant social and environmental issues.<br><br>One stark example is the historical exploitation of labor, epitomized by events like the Coal Wars in the United States. During the early 20th century, coal miners faced incredibly harsh working conditions, low pay, and the constant threat of injury or death. Their efforts to unionize and strike for better conditions were often met with violent responses, including interventions by the National Guard. Such incidents underscore the potential for capitalism to exploit workers when devoid of strong labor protections and regulations.<br><br>Environmental impact is another critical area of concern. The pursuit of profit in capitalist systems can, and often does, lead to environmental degradation. This is evident in the contrast between industrialized and non-industrialized cultures. For instance, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, driven by the capitalist motives of logging, agriculture, and mining, starkly contrasts with the sustainable practices of indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with their environment for centuries. The current climate crisis, largely fueled by the carbon emissions of industrialized nations, is a testament to the environmental cost of unregulated industrial activity.<br><br>Moreover, the issue of social inequality is an inherent risk in capitalist systems. While capitalism can generate immense wealth, this wealth is often unevenly distributed, leading to significant disparities. The growing gap between the richest and the poorest, both within countries and globally, raises questions about the social sustainability of current economic models.<br><br>While capitalism has been a driving force in creating modern prosperity, its unregulated form can lead to labor exploitation, environmental destruction, and social inequality. These challenges highlight the necessity of thoughtful regulation and the implementation of policies that ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of human welfare and environmental sustainability. The goal should be to strike a balance where the dynamism of capitalism is harnessed, but its excesses are curbed, ensuring a fair and sustainable future for all."

In other words free enterprice is the way but it has been sabotaged by the corrupt financial system.

Our government is dumping money into big business especially Quebec companies. Buying pipelines because they want to not because it makes the most sense. Forcing agendas in our schools that will be damaging to our children&#39;s state of mind. Our Prime Minister was taught how to screw the people from his father who put the wheels in motion to change Canada forever and not for the better. If he gets back in then we know we have nothing but fools for voters.

Reading some of these posts, the foolish people in our world don‚Äôt like what this man said.   I just cannot imagine the World Economic Forum welcoming him to speak, but thank goodness he did.  <br><br>Someone mentioned Capitalism.  Without Capitalism men and women would still be living in Medieval times.  At one time it was the Aristocracy of the world who kept the working population down.  Now the multiple Nouveau Riche throughout the world, are as bad, if not worse than they were.   The likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and many others have made their billions on the backs of the ordinary people of our world come to mind.  And socialism is not the answer, as that form of governance keeps people down.   We are NOT all equal in intelligence or work ethic.   But that is what these people at the World Economic Forum are telling us.  They think they have the right to rule us, and to take away our freedoms and rights as human beings.   <br><br>This gentleman has touched on everything that affects every human being‚Äôs life, and it is so wonderful to hear someone tell it like it is.  Our world is full of followers, not leaders.   And too many leaders in our world today have been won over to the dark side by the lure of money.   And that old saying that money is the root of all evil has been proven repeatedly over the past few years, especially in North America."

This planet will be unlivable under the demonic socialist agenda. Beautiful speech. Humble yourselves WEF. Use your powers to fight for what is right or Cowardly cave to ideas proven to not work.

@energymarketchile,2024-01-19 20:02:13+00:00,2024-01-19 20:02:13+00:00,0,"All very well, but giving carte blanche to the multinational corporations is ensuring that people will not even have reasonable jobs, that the natural resources of the countries will be devastated without leaving anything to the States (countries) from which they are extracted, and worse, the People will not have any right to defend themselves against mega-consortia.<br>What is needed is a State representative of the interests of the population at each country (true democracy), where the corruptive force of corporations in the political sphere is nullified, and politicians make reasonable decisions that promote the common good, and do not benefit the &quot;elites&quot; that Milei mentions. Milei errs in thinking that the elites are groups separate from the mega-corporations, when in reality they are the owners of the latter and all the crimes that we have seen increase to scandalous levels in these last four years are caused by mega-corporations, controlled by the elite that owns them, and that has managed to get into the pockets of every politician in every once prosperous country. In other words, he promises what we all want, but putting the shadow of the benefit of the popular doubt on delinquent businessmen.<br>Or someone is going to tell me that Gates, Bezos, and in Argentina, the two most powerful, are white doves... All the suffering that we have seen starting from the covid19 pandemic, the undeclared wars, the losses in pension equity funds, etc., all are the result of the excessive control that these billionaires exercise over the market, for which there is no mechanism to stop them. In effect, its abuse of monopoly power has eliminated the true creative capitalist force: small and medium-sized businesses, since large corporations have taken it upon themselves to eliminate them using politicians and their globalist 2030 agenda to make them cease to exist... True freedom will come when the excessive powers that corporations have compared to small businesses and individuals are eliminated. I&#39;m not saying that entrepreneurship and market freedom must be eliminated, we just have to eliminate the bad elements that contaminate and destroy it from within, and put reasonable limits to prevent this to happen again."

The US may be a closer model to the one he is talking about, but other Western nations have embraced elements of collectivism within free market capitalism. Unbridled libertarianism is a myth because of the competing elements within the market. Competition between labour and capital is one example. Governments can operate as a mediating factor in this scenario and also operate as advocates and mediators  in international market disputes. Governments can also act as the warning bell. To assume that free market growth can continue without checks and balances is like a train without any brakes hurtling towards a precipice."

@stefashaler8340,2024-01-19 19:37:22+00:00,2024-01-19 19:37:22+00:00,0,"Baffling argument that leaves out such obvious facts that within our free market capitalist system, around 8 men have collected as much &#39;wealth&#39; as 3.6 billion people on earth, around half the population. And that when the GDP dominates the system as it does in free market capitalism, it devours and destroys other forms of wealth: morals, spirit, safety, justice, community. For example, drug and human trafficking cartels thrive. They amp up GDPs.  Wars send GDPs through the roof. Mr. Melei also fails to mention that mega corporations are faithfully bailed out of bankruptcy by the working class. The story of businesses that can&#39;t survive on their own going out of business is a dream--a nightmare for the general public that is squeezed out of business by voracious mega-companies taking over everything, metastasizing over the globe and recently, space. It&#39;s crystal clear that elites wouldn&#39;t be proposing any kind of social adjustment if they didn&#39;t realized free market capitalism has their backs against the wall with problems the system cannot address in any effective way. They became elites in the free market system, so obviously like it but they see that it can&#39;t hold together much longer. Those who imagine material wealth is the only index of human development are prone to not seeing the catastrophes they face when the &#39;wealth&#39; goes berserk."

It is better than Westminister, where everybody agrees with everybody else. When Starmer left the WEF, he was clutching his orders, and on his return to the UK, he announced labour policy change, and the new  policies he announced were straight from the WEF, and they mirrored the policies the WEF, Rishi Sunak is a WEF young leader and everthing does fall into what the WEF dictates. Sunak is happy for Starmer to be the next PM because he will be passing on the mantle to a fellow WEF believer and policy pusher. On the board of the WEF is Larry Finks of black Rock, who owns Vangaurd. Between the two companies, they own 8 trillion dollars of global assets and most of the world media companies. They use those the media companies to call anybody who questions the WEF plans for man an conspiracy theorists  to make them like they are mad and wears a tin foil hate. I would say 80% of the global population have no idea how they are munipulated to think how the WEF want them to think by media channels and news channels,  and via television programmes. It is a slow programming. They have found a new way, and that is to indoctrinate from the first day a child starts school. It is no accident how the woke culture is taught in our schools, from transgender to everybody who decides to leave their 3rd world country is a refugee. Mass immigration that is happening in Europe and the US is planned and paid for by an unknown group. I bet it is a group linked to the WEF and UN."

Different socio-economic models have cons and pros. So far, free market is one of the most effective models but it has Achilles Spots and the tendency to monopolization is one of such weaknesses, it eventually renders free-market to become to be non-free market. So, antimonopoly regulation is required to fix it but any regulation contradicts free-market, such inconsistency of a pure free-market model can be resolved and it has been resolved in USA by slight modification of free market model from the middle   of 1930ths by antimonopoly acts; but, even an earlier version of free-market had such regulation (The Sherman Antitrust Act)."

While on the surface Javier‚Äôs screed hits many of the libertarian hot buttons (many of which I agree with) it‚Äôs critical to put this speech in context. This is the speech that the pirates will make just before picking your pockets and throwing you overboard to the sharks.<br><br>Milei uses gross generalities such as comparing abortion rights to a socialist form of population control, positioning all competing political groups/philosophies as parasitic soul sucking bureaucrats compared to his vision of a benevolent and perfect meritocracy of idealistic entrepreneurs. This is reminiscent of Ayn Rand‚Äôs juvenile nonsense. <br><br>Consider the absolutely critical inflection point the 2024 election represents. We are in the early stages of the four biggest societal transformations we‚Äôve ever experienced: transportation, energy, labor and food (Hat tip: Adam Dorr‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrighter‚Äù). As we go through these transitions our society will necessarily go through some very difficult times as we are forced to abandon old ways of managing ourselves and adopt innovative --- and previously unacceptable --- new ways forward. We have two political paths to choose from this year to get us through this difficult beginning.<br><br> On the Democratic side we have a deep and wide bench of (mostly) well intentioned and capable public servants. In the last three years inflation has essentially been tamed (No, high prices aren‚Äôt inflation; they are the result of past inflation), unemployment is very low, massive investments are being made in supporting renewable energy, expansion of EVs and charging networks, fighting climate change, domestic production of microchips, basic infrastructure fixes, rebuilding of global alliances, decisive and strong support for Ukraine, Israel and NATO, and an absolute commitment to personal reproductive rights and our Constitutionally-based government. You don‚Äôt like Biden, fine; he‚Äôll be gone before, or no later than, the 2028 elections. Our democracy is designed to refresh itself through election cycles. Don‚Äôt like something? Get engaged, vote, run for office and make changes within our system.<br><br>On the other side of the aisle is the GOP, which has completely transformed into MAGA. Of which their bench is one person wide and deep. And his intended legislative positions and historical record are literally the opposite of all the evidence and positions mentioned above. And this won‚Äôt be good for long term business. <br><br>If we, in the Tesla/Elon universe, can put aside our short term frustrations with Biden‚Äôs unhinged pro-union, Mary Barra fluffing words and focus on the actions and legislation that have actually occurred the choice becomes much clearer: We can abandon our Constitutional Republic and go with the know-nothing, prima donna, narcissistic, fascist cowboy or support and force change from within the progressive, evidence-based, forward thinking Democratic party."

Now we have monopolies and environmental problems . Notice China found a solution to all that by removing democracy from the equation, and capitalism seems to be working good there, and that makes more complex the dilemma for the west.

Democratic political institutions and US military superiority amplify these forces of finance (See Pareto Laws and financial debt and leverage). 2) Value being sucked from the periphery to the center leads to greater wealth and income gaps, both within nations and between nations. 3) This leads to domestic and international unrest and conflict - politically and socially. 4) The economic and political collapse of the periphery leads to regional conflicts in the struggle over shrinking resources and this means hot wars as well as political chaos. <br>5) This results in mass migrations of refugees and their chosen destination is the center sucking up all the value, which is the West and especially the USA. At the same time it invites global resentment.<br><br>It&#39;s astounding that open border advocates cannot draw the obvious conclusions and how disastrous this will be for their political agenda, chaos notwithstanding. As you can see from the sequence, it all starts with fiat monetary regime mismanagement at the Fed in coordination with the C5 central banks. It&#39;s all been engineered by baby boom leaders who have assumed they are all-deserving of their elite power status. The world pays for their hubris."

I hear him glorifying capatalism and demonizing socialism.  No civilazation can survive in the long term with such an inbalanced idealogy.  Its his right to share his idealogy but its hardly the only one and its freedom of choice that democracy is meant to protect.  My belief is that we should be careful to not summarize complex social economic concepts by naming them and using them as propoganda for movements.  It only creates an excuse not to think for ones self and that makes them easily exploitable.  They are only meant to be an introduction to an idea.

It is like a warning and a wake-up call to all Western countries such as the US, who is walking down this path of eventual self-destruction. Socialism and the ever expansion of the government is NOT the solution to the problem of poverty and starvation of a country. It is just the people who are already in power, trying to control and disorient the normal citizens and make them believe that they are there to take care of them. Socialism leads to more power for the state, thus leading to more separation between the rich and the poor. Eventually, the gap will get so big that there will be division and civil unrest, thus leading to the collapse of that country. Argentina knows this well. They went through all of this within the last few decades. Our president in the White House better open up his ears and listen, as we are sliding down the same slope that will only end up in the collapse of our society."

I&#39;m almost convinced that libertarianism has tremendous power to improve all our lives and reduce poverty as the speaker says.... but I&#39;ve never heard how it takes environmental protection into account.  I think libertarian theory needs to be somehow expanded to include environmental health (including species diversity, rich ecosystems, natural abundance, clean air, etc. etc.).  If every entrepreneur is allowed free reign to exploit natural resources, well, yes, poverty may reduce, per capita income may rise, all may seem good -- until our air becomes unbreathable, our lands become agriculturally diminished, our fisheries dwindle, our climate becomes unlivable, etc. etc.  This MUST be taken into account, or we&#39;ll all hit a wall -- the poor and the rich alike."

Capitalism, if unregulated by community morals and justice, empowers ruthless psychopaths to become enormously powerful to the point that they control the political system and democracy becomes a charade. Another glaring error in his speech is the fact that energy is a main driving component of economic growth. It was the discovery of so called &#39;fossil&#39; fuels that vastly leveraged labour and facilitated the economic prosperity of the last 150 years. It was energy combined with capitalism. Now globalism combined with fascism threatens human freedom and individual prosperity."

I think this would be a much more inclusive model that would allow the entire world to have the nessicary tools to contribute to the world economy if desired. Right now there are only a few players making the decisions and dictating policy. Whenever a small minority is making decisions for the majority, it is very seldom if at all that these decisions will benefit the masses...."

What big companies are doing on supply side in the name of profits. Make no mistake, there will always be a need for the state to curb the power of ultra wealthy and nobody will ever pay their taxes of their own will, but we still need the services that the state is providing, be it courts, so that not every dispute needs to be settled by personal duel, military, so that other states can&#39;t endanger us, or healthcare, so that we don&#39;t end up like in USA, where massive debts stemming from healthcare services provided, non uncommonly at brink of death, are the greatest cause of personal bankruptcies. If society is to survive, some level of coercion is necessary and inevitable, because he/she, who gains enough power will become hegemon in the system and start to create and enforce rules as it fits them, because they don&#39;t feel the need to not infringe on others. Humans have simply not evolved to obide by the rules needed for this kind of approach to be sustainable for more than a generation. Has Argentina gone waaay too far left in the past? Yes.

@glendakirby5579,2024-01-19 14:24:16+00:00,2024-01-19 14:24:16+00:00,0,"No matter what system you choose, if the operators are corrupt and that corruption is purposely spread throughout all your institutions, a constipation of the whole system will ensue that will bring everything crashing down. The type of people involved in this are of course morally bankrupt and together form a club that enjoys what once was considered the unspeakable deviation of every conceivable sort and many that are beyond the normal imagination. If you think that is a wild over statement be a fly on the wall of those in high office in any Western Government, or Royalty, particularly Washington, or WEFminster. Then delve into what happens in the tunnels and dark places below these buildings, and I include places of worship. You will need a strong constitution. It really doesn&#39;t matter how good the set up is, if those in charge are evil the direction of travel will continue downward. Adding to the decline over the years has been the secret societies like Freemasonry which is full of demonic references which demand greater adherence the higher the rank. Those beyond 33deg level only being for the top echelons of society. It can be no coincidence that as our spiritual lives have fallen into neglect, so our care for each other, and our responsibility for each other has tanked. Industrialists during the British Industrial Revolution were often staunch non conformist Christians, God fearing who expected to have to answer to a Deity for their dealings with those over whom they had huge power. They were the ones who paid a fair wage, gave bonuses, and provided safe clean places of work, even occasionally schooling for the children with nature trips out of the grime occasionally. The New Testament in those days was a force to be reckoned with ,and plenty of hell fire preachers giving sermons to packed churches. It was control of course, but a lot of it if done in the right spirit created good social practices that are not adhered to today .So in my opinion it is the collapse of moral standards no matter where they stem from that has created the situation we face, and only a speedy return to those origins that promote them will save us, and they certainly won&#39;t be found at Davos."

It kind of feels like that&#39;s starting to happen - but it&#39;s pissing off the Marxists... It&#39;s like, hang it up man - Marxism doesn&#39;t work and can&#39;t be reconfigured to be anywhere near as effective, free and productive as Capitalism - you tend to end up with psychotic dictators like Stalin, Mao, Kim, Pol Pot, etc.. Not to mention the fact that Marxism at its core - regardless of its stated purpose - stifles freedom and takes power and resources from the people and centralizes them into the hands of a few party members for supposed &quot;redistribution&quot; and those people invariably abuse their position to enrich themselves at the expense of the greater population... Capitalism isn&#39;t perfect either but unlike Marxism, it has been proven to work and enhance people&#39;s lives and enrich the population over and over - plus, Capitalism has the flexibility to adapt, evolve, improve, address its issues, etc. where Marxism remains rigid and stagnant. Also, the wealth produced in Capitalist societies allows for the funding of the abundant social welfare programs typically touted by Marxism. Personally, I think Capitalism works so well because it embraces human nature whereas Marxism (supposedly) tries - and fails - to fight it."

The biggest one being the usual mistake of looking at global per capita GDP from the 18 hundres and foward. Capitalism has its roots in the 16 hundreds. From 1600-1800 global poverty increased dramatically with the birth of capitalism. Capitalism is not a flawless system, it creates toxic incentives that makes people go over bodies. The abstraction of time and human life into currency makes humans suffer greatly. There shouldn&#39;t be single people with millions and billions making decisions that cost lifes without them ever noticing or caring. We can come up with a better system over time I&#39;m sure."

While free markets determine the best allocation of resources to satisfy consumer desire I don&#39;t believe that they provide what is best for a society. I do also believe free market capitalism better serves those who most powerful, or wealthy, while those who are least powerful become exploited to satisy the tastes of the wealthy. The end of capitalism is a caste system is the style of socialism where one caste controls the resources and influences government policy to their own benefit. I believe both fail over a long enough timeline."

Demolishing central bank, switching to dolar based currency system leaving the country to winds and waves of others with less power of control over the economy."
@piscesman54,2024-01-19 12:00:32+00:00,2024-01-19 12:00:32+00:00,0,"There are a few troubling things about Milei that most people outside of Argentina are not aware of. To begin with, he&#39;s a staunch supporter of Israel, a murderous, oppressive, racist State, currently executing one of the most horrific genocides in modern history. So one has to wonder how that jives with the libertarian ideas he so boldly proclaims. He&#39;s also closely linked to and sponsored by the Jewish Orthodox Jabad-Lubavitch organization that was recently in the news for some serious incidents involving secret tunnels at its headquarters in New York, with some very bizarre ramifications. In fact, he traveled there and visited said headquarters less than a month back.<br>It&#39;s fairly easy to make bold speeches decrying collectivism. Unfortunately, actions speak louder than words. Milei is not what he&#39;s made himself out to be. He recently issued what has been termed as a mega-decree, which is virtually tantamount to a full-fledged constitutional reform that would give the Executive full powers to do pretty much whatever it wants. This decree has yet to go through Congress, which is under the opposition‚Äôs control, but in Argentina that‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be easily fixed with a few bribes. However, he might have to make some concessions in order to allow the opposition to save face. The decree includes one obscure article whereby the president is given the power to &#39;invite&#39; foreign military forces to conduct operations on Argentinean territory. No mention is made of what forces those might be, what the actual scope of their operations would be, or how long they would be allowed to operate on Argentinean soil. So, again, how is that consistent with less obtrusive governance and individual freedom, not to mention that it raises some serious questions about the man&#39;s allegiance. Bear in mind that Argentina has the third largest Jewish community in the world, and Patagonia was one of the locations considered by early Zionist leaders for the establishment of the State of Israel. Today, it stands virtually defenseless, as Argentina&#39;s military has been scaled down to operational unviability. To make matters worse, it is very scarcely populated. <br>So please, dig deeper, question, research. Don&#39;t be fooled by eloquent speeches. Investigate what goes on in back rooms behind closed doors."

A free market economy has created a wealth disparity that is heading us back to the wealth structure of the eighteenth century, where most people were effectively slaves for the landed gentry. Just because GDP grows does not mean most of us are better off than our parents. The middle class grew out of the end of WW2, as home ownership (which is the cornerstone of being middle class) and peeked around 20 years ago. Modern day poverty always seems to be measured in monitory terms, but there are other ways to measure poverty. Loneliness, bad health, no future prospects to name a few which are becoming endemic in much of the world. The amount of money now in circulation is now around 280 T$, which is why GDP increases. But as a planet we are dying and simply increasing the speed that money moves around the planet will not bring the end of poverty for the majority."

Something fishy is going on here - almost seems like the massive companies and businessmen comprising the economic forum have unleashed the fear of socialism on the population in order to spark a knee-jerk reaction by the populous involving going as far from that path as possible; a totally free market, leaving their own investments free to gobble up smaller competition and gain more wealth and soft power."

Taxing of labor is directly indentured perpetual servitude to the ruling government. A crime of brutal human slavery. It is corporatism... a vile construct the devours our humanity! We must as a human race adopt the values of the individual. A model that is the base of the Constitution of the US... established by We the People! We do not have this ideal held today... It must be restored! ML and Blessings all!

@TheWeirdSide1,2024-01-19 08:40:19+00:00,2024-01-19 08:40:19+00:00,0,"Free market capitalism is wonderful!   ...if only it could be implemented.   The best you will find is crony capitalism and goods created in other countries under communist rule and employment sent to 3rd world countries.  Free market capitalism only works if the capitalist&#39;s are incentivized to create wealth for the home country(whoops).  As it stands,  they simply seek cheap labor elsewhere and we import goods from china.  It&#39;s a real dream, yeah right.   It works so well that all but a few are engaged in criminal activity of one degree or another.  Lawyers and judges go where the money is, not where the justice is.  Real-estate is highly limited and everyone knows it.  Billionaires who owe all their fortune to the working class who buy their products and create them rarely give back what they take, under denial of &#39;creating jobs&#39;.  Amazon created only one thing,  dead end jobs that can&#39;t pay for a shack and fuel for china.  It&#39;s a great dream.  But welcome to reality.  The only reason I&#39;m not starving today is because I finally gave in and sought government assistance.  Which is socialism.   Americans are not starving because of socialism.  Which is paid for by the few rich people who do pay back."

We are living in a war full of war, massive poverty, and monopolies of the rich. 1% literally holds more wealth than 99%. The world have more than enough wealth to eliminate poverty forever. No more poverty will mean no more acts of desperation and eventually no crime. So why follow a liar who is so confident in his lie he can say it&#39;s sunny when it&#39;s a blizzard outside. Join the Collective, where your happiness is the priority. once you experience the true freedom of the collective you will wonder why it took so long to do something so simple. And the answer is simple you were brainwashed by the elite to think working will make you rich and like hamster you kept running.

@danstenis660,2024-01-19 06:53:39+00:00,2024-01-19 06:56:49+00:00,0,"Milei talks of freedom and capitalism like he knows what they really are.  Capitalism leads to the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.  Eventually, rich people will own the whole world if you give them the freedom to own everything and enslave everyone.  Rich people live like kings and queens and will never give up their wealth and power.  Rich people will kill as many people as needed to maintain their power over the world, and many more as needed to make an example of you so you don&#39;t forget and overstep your bound.  Rich people wants to brainwash the mass to believe that capitalism and freedom goes hand in hand, but that is to brainwash you to continue to support the current Western society so that rich people can continue to get even richer until they own the whole world and have everyone enslaved.  If freedom and democracy exists in a capitalist society, that would mean that the people voted to be poor and enslaved by the rich and that people gave away their freedom as slaves while the rich has unlimited freedom to enslave everyone.  Nobody voted to be slaves and nobody voted for the few rich people to have all the freedom to enslave the rest of the people.  The rich uses fear tactics to get people to support the current capitalist system.  The people are so brainwashed by the ideas of democracy and freedom and the fear of being enslaved and losing democracy and freedom that they can&#39;t even see that they are brainwashed into supporting their own enslavement.  Milei is spreading the same propaganda to his people, who are very ignorant of the world, so they naturally believe any propaganda of freedom, democracy, and capitalism.  If Americans fall for the same propaganda of democracy, freedom, and capitalism, it is very easy to see how the rest of the world can easily be brainwashed to support capitalism when it is falsely associated with democracy and freedom.  When you have freedom and democracy, you would vote for communism, not capitalism, because communism is about having a fair system that helps everyone equally.  Capitalism pretends to be the system that helps everyone equally, but in practice, it helps the top elites at the expense of the people.  You can observe capitalism in America operating.  The rich is getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The USA starts one war after another to siphon government debt into the pockets of the military industrial complex at the expense of American taxpayers.  After the USA destroys a country, it then lends loans for post-war reconstruction of that country.  When those loans are defaulted, the banks then owns those infrastructures and enslaves that country.  This is how the rich elite Americans pillage and enslave the world.  If a country is a communist country, the USA cannot debt trap that country and own that country (e.g., Russia).  By promoting capitalism through propaganda of democracy and freedom, the USA elites can invade, destroy, debt trap, and enslave any country it wants to.  Allies of the USA are just puppets of the USA.  These puppet governments are being bribed by the rich American elites at the expense of their people.  Milei is just another puppet of the USA.  How much is Milei being paid by the USA to sell the souls of his people to the American Devils?"

If there is no government, theres noone to punish theft or robberies for example making free market capitalism impossible and you instead get anarchy. You want your government to be limited and respect peoples right to freedom and privacy like USA in many red conservative states practiced a few decades back, and run by biblical principles, capitalism is close to biblical principles in many ways but upholding biblical values and faith is what the country really need.

A mixed free-market and socially democratic system has been proven to be superior to a purely free-market based economy. The countries that have implemented it well with a light and strong touch in certain areas have thrived, and are some of the wealthiest economies in history. This video wastes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtegqgKYR-U&amp;t=1147"">19:07</a> seconds of your time with a bad faith argument. I decided to watch the whole thing in the end. Companies cannot govern themselves without the guard rails of sometimes extensive regulation. They have proven time and time again that they will endanger the entire world economy by making the riskiest and craziest bets while experimenting on the entire world with said schemes. And then with these failures they then run to the government to bail them out at the expense of the tax payer.

You need to fund these collectively. <br><br>I&#39;m not arguing that socialism and very high taxes are better, but it is obviously a matter of striking a balance between competing values and interests and hopefully we can get as close as possible to an optimal balance.

Smith properly identified capitalism as the fastest way to grow an economy; but, then he said the economy can become sated.   When that happens capitalism has to morph, or life becomes miserable.  Capitalism does not have to be abandoned in order for it to accommodate a sated status.  By morphing to include some aspects of socialism does not require loss of entrepreneurship, private property,  or accumulation of wealth.   Currently this goes on in closely held private corporations."

In this instance the Left tells people to trust emotions. This then denies the individual a counterweight to the emotional domain with an intellectual accounting and opens the door to the emotional self oppressing the intellectual self. This is what happens when ideologies stop short of their logical conclusion: ignorance, and often the thing that one wishes to avoid becomes the inevitable conclusion of a fragmented individual."

I will focus on this.<br><br>Capitalism, like all things, is not perfect, and he does not talk about its problems. One of the biggest is cost externalities, in which people not party to a transaction bear a cost. This sounds academic, but it manifests, for example, as mine owners dumping tailings into a river. Drinking water and fishing -- each being forms of natural wealth -- are depleted to save money for the mine owners, perhaps less than is non-consensually extracted from the river users. Protecting against cost externalities is a prime function of governments.<br><br>He also talks about how government should not provide services but instead let services be handled by businesses, since they are more efficient. One problem with this is, what does efficiency look like for a government entity? Take police, for example -- should they make a certain number of arrests to fulfill quotas? Should we have only private police? If you cannot afford private police, do you not get protection or justice? Governments (in democracies) take actions on behalf of citizens as demanded, and all are expected to pay up as appropriate for their economic status.<br><br>He speaks of taxes as a form of coercion. This is true, people with guns will lock you in a cage if you do not pay up. But where is a state without taxation? There are failed states, but these are run by warlords who extract tribute for protection -- taxes by another name. Taxes will ultimately be paid, and in exchange you (ought to) get civilization.<br><br>But let&#39;s say we magically get rid of taxes, and everyone lives without government. Then some people and together and start doing crime. What then? You will need to form you own autodefense group, complete with obligatory contributions in time, material, and money -- taxes again!<br><br>If socialists gain support criticizing capitalism, it&#39;s because they have a point -- many have their wants satisfied while many have their needs neglected. This is a problem libertarians do not acknowledge, capitalism&#39;s price signals do not distinguish between needs and wants: a rich person can buy all the water for their pool while the impoverished go thirsty. <br><br>He talks about capitalism being the greatest mechanism for wealth creation that the world has ever seen, and he talks about ever increasing GDP-per-capita figures, but behind this hides the distribution of that wealth. Who actually has it? Do those without it have enough to survive, to thrive, to challenge the wealthy with better business offerings? An enormous amount of wealth accumulated is coercive in its own right, and balanced only by the collective will of the people -- that is, the rule of law under a democratic government. <br><br>Milei is an extremist borne of extreme circumstances. Extremists are often have a point but are blinded to the flaws of their viewpoint. Just as the communists denigrated humanity for the promise of a utopia, Milei is so repelled by government that he cannot see its purpose.<br><br>I hope that he delivers the shock that Argentina needs to become peaceful and prosperous. Hopefully his corrections will not cause so many problems that it gives life to an extremist opposition."

However, to suggest that Capitalism can&#39;t be moderated with &#39;social justice&#39; is just a Far Right wolf cry, and should be avoided just as much as Far Left calls to full socialism/communism.  Yes, GDP is growing more than ever now- however, the middle class is also SHRINKING now and their economic growth for the past 50 years has been almost flat.  You have to address these inequalities or the door opens for extremism.  Keep in mind &#39;pure capitalism&#39; drove monopolies and extremely poor working conditions for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Putting into place so-called Social Justice programs to mitigate these conditions enabled GDP growth across economic sectors- it was these changes, in addition to GDP growth, that shrunk poverty."

Monopolies can raise prices through manipulation or short term cutthroat pricing which in the long term can hurt consumers. Also the state needs to insure costs are assigned to producers to properly reflect market conditions. Example is making sure oil companies are assigned cost of plastification of the seas and environment as well as carbons released. This can be done through regulations rather than excessive taxation which I agree is counterproductive. Other than those caveats I wholeheartedly agree.

@martinguila,2024-01-18 21:01:15+00:00,2024-01-18 21:01:15+00:00,20,I think politicians and economists often miss the enormous role of the enlightenment in making the world richer and free. The enlightenment is about freedom in terms of exchanging ideas and a tradition of criticism and capitalism freedom in terms of trade so they go together.  But I would argue the enlightenment is even more fundamental to how the world has changed and the hockey stick graph he refereed to.
