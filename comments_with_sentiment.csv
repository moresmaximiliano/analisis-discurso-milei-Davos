He&#39;s basically advocating for lessaiz-faire economy, no-state, just businesses. So, anarcho-capitalism. It&#39;s just baffling to me how one can propose such a thing, when some big businesses, if left unchecked, will wreck havoc on the planet, the environment, society etc like they have for hundreds of years now. Yes, capitalism has taken us far, but the system only cares about profit and the accumulation of capital. Social, environmental responsibility isn&#39;t written into it, that&#39;s why there has to be an entity (call it the state) that handles such inefficiencies. Yes, too much concentrated power on the state is bad, but capitalism if left unchecked leads to big monopolies --&gt; a few companies taking over. On the one hand capitalists say the state is bad because it holds too much power, on the other leftists-statists-collectivists say capitalism is bad because it leads to capital accumulation on a few hands. Both of them are right!! Problem isn&#39;t with capitalism or socialism, the problem is with CONCENTRATED POWER. We must not let either big businesses get too big, buy everything, destroy the planet, or big governments have too much power, drown-out businesses, spread corruption etc. <br>It&#39;s really sad to not see people try to see things objectively anymore. I&#39;m either bombarded by leftists or anarchocapitalists. Anyways, inequality is at an all-time-high. This guy is just looking at the stats and numbers that he likes and that serve his theory of how anarcho-capitalism is great. Rest of you delighting in the comments, saying he&#39;s like a hero for spewing neo-liberal propaganda: why?",positive

More than anything: &quot;global GDP increase was stagnant up until 1800s&quot; is really saying; large scale increase in GPD happened when we departed the Gold standard of currency.

In every way they reducing costs (using cheaper materials, generating more toxic waste and just sink it) to achieve more profit. Raising prices, markets want more profit so they raising prices too... They say the population damaging the earth... So raising prices.. But in reality the extreme growing profit hunger damaging the earth and the peoples health. Rich ones want to be more rich and want the other 99,99% to be as poor as possible.. to work hard and make more profit for them... It&#39;s like the car projects... E cars aren&#39;t saving anything just a good buisnes... Cars only producing about 1% emissions from the global emission rate... Carbon footprint? Toxic wastes from Li battery producting etc. Doesn&#39;t matter just buy our expensive e-car and burn the old ones. If we stop producting of short life scrap and start to make longlasting good stuff the cost would be barely higher.. If you buy a car and it last 30-40 or more yrs with minimal repair it much less carbon or toxic footprint. And not just cars.. In every way we should follow this and we save the world. Like light bulb cartel. Waste no matter if it profits. Electronical devices too. They got slow and working badly. Not because they got weaker or damaged. The companies want you to buy new one always. See the specs of an old Z2 phone which have strength to play 1080p vids, good graph games and the internet was fast on it. Now that hardware can&#39;t run messenger? 😂 This is the real problem.

Javier Milei argues that free market capitalism has lifted 90% of the world&#39;s population out of poverty and is the only morally desirable system to achieve it. He cites the historical data that shows how economic growth has accelerated since the 19th century and that countries with free markets are much richer than those with repressed markets.<br><br>2. <b>*Socialism*</b> is a failed system that leads to poverty and misery. Javier Milei argues that socialism has always and everywhere been a failure, and that it is responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people. He claims that the main problem with the West today is that it is being undermined by its own leaders who are advocating for socialism.<br><br>3. <b>*Neoclassical economic theory*</b> is flawed and leads to socialism. Javier Milei argues that neoclassical economic theory is based on a flawed model of the market, and that this leads to regulations that hinder economic growth and open the door to socialism. He claims that the solution to market failures is not more regulation, but less.<br><br>4. The <b>*West*</b> is in danger of embracing socialism. Javier Milei argues that the West is facing a significant threat because its leaders are co-opted by a world that inevitably leads to socialism. He warns that if the West continues on this path, it will condemn itself to poverty and misery.<br><br>5. <b>*Entrepreneurs*</b> are heroes who contribute to society. Javier Milei argues that entrepreneurs are not villains, but heroes who create jobs and contribute to the well-being of society. He encourages entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by the political class and to continue to create wealth.<br><br>6. The moral underpinnings of <b>*free market capitalism*</b> are superior to those of socialism. Javier Milei claims that free markets incentivize hard work and innovation, while socialism rewards idleness and discourages individual achievement.<br><br>7. Specific examples of how <b>*free markets*</b> have lifted people out of poverty are provided. Javier Milei mentions the economic booms in China and India in recent decades, and attributes these to their embrace of free market principles.<br><br>8. Acknowledging that <b>*free markets*</b> are not perfect, Javier Milei argues that the benefits of free markets far outweigh the drawbacks, and that the best way to address inequality is through economic growth, not government redistribution.<br><br>9. Javier Milei criticizes what he sees as a growing trend of <b>*anti-capitalism*</b> in the West. He blames this trend on a number of factors, including the rise of social media, the decline of traditional institutions, and the increasing influence of identity politics.<br><br>10. Javier Milei concludes with a **call to action**, urging viewers to defend free markets and to fight against the spread of socialism. He believes that the future of the West depends on our ability to preserve the principles of individual liberty and economic freedom.<br><br>Even though some details might be missed in this summary, I hope that you found it useful.",positive

Every brand is owned by some other company which is owned by another, and they decide who can compete and when. It&#39;s delusional to believe that our progress as a human race is because of capitalism, we are where we are despite capitalism. Much of the progress we have made in the modern era has been delayed because something that was groundbreaking wasn&#39;t marketed enough or didn&#39;t make it to the people who could see its potential.

Milei called her rivals everything from &quot;diabolical dwarves&quot; to &quot;blood-sucking parasites&quot;.<br>Milei is a dog lover and on this point there is something to say. His former favorite dog, Conan, has his own Wikipedia page. Milei has claimed that he and Conan first met in the Colosseum in a past life. Back then, 2,000 years ago, Conan was a lion and Milei a gladiator. But instead of fighting to the death, they became best friends.<br>Conan has since been cloned and these four clones are all named after economists that Milei likes and is inspired by.<br>Javier Milei often seeks out mediums and claims to be able to communicate with his late dog Conan. Incidentally, it was in a medium trip like this that Conan, together with God, is said to have persuaded Milei to stand in the presidential election in the first place.<br>Milei has had a verbal spat with Pope Francis, who is also from Argentina. He has called the Pope a &quot;disgusting leftist&quot; and accused him of consorting with &quot;communist murderers&quot;. Something for which he later apologized.<br>There has been much speculation about the relationship with sister Karina in Argentina. Politicians usually don&#39;t bother to comment on these types of issues, but in direct connection with the election last winter, Javier Milei took to social media with a denial: That he does not have a sexual relationship with his own sister.<br>Purely in terms of appearance, Milei stands out. His well-grown sideburns bring to mind the superhero Wolverine. He himself has said that he never does his hair, but rather sticks his head out the car window on the way to work in the morning and lets the wind do the trick.<br>Milei is behind several controversial proposals. Among other things, he wants to ban abortion again, which became legal in Argentina only four years ago, and has opened up to allow organ sales.&quot;<br><br>I wont even bother to say what I think I just copy pasted some information, people should read a lot and analyse a lot before believing everything people tell them specially when so well put like he did...if people used more their skepticism many conflicts during history til today could have been avoided.<br>Only thing I will say thou about the topic of abortion, everyone deserves the freedom to dicide what to do with their bodies, abortion should be anyones right and religion should stay the hell out of it, for accident, rape, due to complications for the mother or baby, or even if you realise you cant give it a good life, so many children forced into the world due to this bullshit agaisnt abortion that suffer a lot during their lives if not all, die early or before being born...<br>So many of those children who turn out to be bad members of society (violent, criminals etc), if anything you know what you should focus your attention? not on abortion but on controlled parenting, by means of to be a good model ,responsible parent or not, and if not, not be allowed to have children, if only society would focus on the correct things, in a world where many societies have way to many children without any control whatsoever...<br><br>Seeing most of the comments here thou, I doubt anyone cares about what I just said and will just consider me a nobody with stupid ideologies :) I do believe the world needs a positive change in many fields, be it politically, financially, freedom, justice, law, anti corruption, stay away from privatising also since that will be the downfall of middle and lower class, if the state is failing its the fault of how it is structured and corruption inside of it , not that it doesnt work.",negative

The nations with the highest standard of living on the planet are the nations with a relatively low Gini coefficient and high taxes. Good healthcare, a good educational system, good infrastructure. All state run. And most of the time highly efficient. The US healthcare system is not only inefficient, it is also extremely expensive. It&#39;s not entrepreneurship, which creates big incomes. It&#39;s size. Even in a diversified, export-oriented economy, like the one in Germany, the majority of profits is being raked in by the big, often monopoly like corporations. The Asian &quot;Tiger&quot;states plus China made their way to the top only by a rigid protective and subsidizing policy. Reduction of global poverty was manly made possible by communist China.

This is an attempt :<br><br>This speech sounds very good because he is basically saying that socialism (even partially) is hindering the free market capitalism with taxes, which is true. But the biggest critic of free market is monopoly and wealth unbalance. As well as corruption it can lead to. He only adresses it by saying he is against corrupt people and that dismantling monopoly will make things worse. This is a bit weak of an argument to me, even if we can praise him for wanting to fight corrupt people (could be a lie though, because they both want the same politics). He never adresses wealth unbalance, implying his system will fix it by itself. But this is wrong because unregulated markets automatically creates wealth unbalance, because it is based on the rule of the strongest, and people that draw the shortest stick will not have enough income to fulfill all their basic needs. People overall will have higher income, but the poorer will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to pay for everything at a higher price, and the &quot;freedom&quot; to chose between paying their bills OR go to a doctor. They will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to go to a doctor...if they go in debt, making their issues long-term worse. Cherry on the cake, this category of people will actually work the most essential jobs and harder ones. This cycle of chaos will keep going as long as the population is high enough, because the system can always replace the &quot;broken people&quot; (who will get sick and die sooner. Ah, isn&#39;t nature GREAT ?)<br>But this is all okay for him because he does not value all human beings the same. <br><br>He also never adresses the weight this system applies to the planet, which cannot be denied, and will even be more obvious in the next decades. Infinite growth is not possible in a limited (even if abundant) environnement.<br><br>Same for feminism. He did not say why it is bad.<br><br>So what&#39;s the solution from here ? I am not necessarily advocating for socialism. I can understand a lot of stuff he said was true in a way. But the complete lack of state and regulations he is advocating for is just an other extreme compared to socialism or communism. We dont need ideologies, we need case-by-case problem solving, starting from solving poverty, food and health issues.<br>Smart stuff was never implemented : what if linked the smallest and highest salary in a company by a factor ?<br>What if we put money in actual factory-side pollution capture ?

It&#39;s a ponzi scheme 🤷🏽‍♂<br>Money is not a finite product generated by people, it is the tool used to avoid equality...<br><br>The problem is that most people don&#39;t know, and don&#39;t know how the system works and these right liberal movements are capitalizing on this (pun intended).<br><br>The reality is that nor from capitalism or the current socialism is fair and human.

What we call revolution nowadays wasn&#39;t anything else than a Putsch, a Coup. When it was indeed to get rid of the sole power of the monarchy, they were already prepared to receive it in between nobles... And we are still today in this framework.<br><br>Money isn&#39;t a tool to quantify freedom nor comfort, money is paper and ink, it has only the value we attribute to it and in a capitalist system, the more we all have and the least it is worth :/<br>Take the case of Venezuella 5 to 10 years ago. When the country&#39;s economy crashed, the issue wasn&#39;t the numbers, but their value. From one day to another, the money wasn&#39;t worth anything, people started fire with thousands of bank notes, just to get warm, made clothes and hand bag with bank notes because it was cheaper than textile...<br><br>Now socialism and comunism propose that the needs will be covered by the community, humanity as a group will carry it&#39;s all burden and collect the fruits. <br>This is an attractive promise, but unfortunately, as long as we will have sharks in power, or ANYONE, in power (for that matter) this will never work...<br><br>As a great comedian/philosopher/activist said:<br>&quot;In the west it&#39;s true that we are all egual.

Within this economic paradigm, the emergence of private monopolies can, albeit unintentionally, give rise to an alternative private governance structure, ultimately resulting in limited substantial change. Furthermore, it is frequently noted that individuals who lack expertise in the domains of industry and engineering tend to engage in discussions that extend beyond their sphere of knowledge.<br><br>As a technocrat, my commitment to opposing the ignorance and arrogance exhibited by anarcho-capitalists, fascists, and proponents of unbridled capitalism remains unwavering, and I shall persist in this endeavor until the end of my days. The dystopian vision of our world is gradually materializing due to the dearth of expertise in the sectors that capitalists oversee. Consequently, the distinction between a 1% led by knowledgeable individuals as opposed to the continuation of crony capitalism, where expertise is often overlooked, becomes a matter of paramount significance.

The people of China are significantly wealthier than those of Argentina, I don’t think anyone in Argentina would claim they are less free. It is possible to be rich and repressed or free and poor.

How that growth has been achieved by the hard work of the many while only the few have reaped the rewards. GDP per capita doesnt take into account redistribution of the wealth. The Great Pyramids also have been wonderful achievements but the slaves were given only water and bread while the pharaos were the owners of the pyramids. <br><br>GDP per Capita means nothing without wealth redistribution index. The only class that is growing in wealth is the rich class thus increasing artificially the average<br><br>2. The Free Market favors the richer trade partner- not poor countries. Poor countries cannot compete with rich countries- this is why the world is divided into 1 billion that leads normal lives and 7 billions that live in poverty. SO much for the achievements of capitalism. <br><br>Excuse my french but I dont wanna live in world where 1 out of 7 people lives good while the rest wallow in poverty so that 1 can live good.,positive

How much do China and North Korea spend on &quot;controlling the masses&quot; and espionage rather than creating wealth, freedom, and safety in their countries?  I hoped Putin would see the power of a strong education system and economic freedom and use that to focus on building a stronger country.  Conversely, in the USA, it has been the economic powerhouses who have had corrupting influence over the system through lobbyists and media control.  In all of these &quot;collectivism&quot; cases, it ends up with leaders who think they know what is best rather than leaders who know how to maximize the untapped power of human capital.

He implies that a capitalist government is better than a socialist government.  He is conflating the free market with monopoly excusing the resulting concentration of wealth as a benefit to all.  His libertarianism mixed with his neoliberal economics results in an oligarchical dictatorship like China where the population is doing better but there are few constraints on the rulers.

Over regulation chokes the free market and unfettered capitalism takes advantage of labor, disgracing the dignity of those that work the hardest and do the most dangerous jobs. This is why labor movements are so important in the development of modern capitalism.

In places with unrestrained capitalism people are returning to poverty from middle class lifestyles. Gone are the days where it was feasible for a family on a normal income to own a house, now even those with high income jobs have trouble finding places to live in the cities where they need to work. Unrestrained free market capitalism is tearing itself appart and pushing people to take action in the west. What currently looks like is creating the best outcome is restrained free market capitalism, as seen in the EU and especially the the scandinavian countries.<br>Basically the flaw is that trickle down economics do not keep working, and at some stage instead starts to have the inverse effect, since at some point the persuit of profit generates tragedy of the commons effects, where to generate more profit for one side it causes greater harm elsewhere, at least initially just compariable to the effect of trickle down economics would have provided there. An example of where it is not just restrained to negative effects on trickle down economics is in terms of climate change, where a lot of economic activity have a more global negative impact causing huge losses, that when accounting for the total value generated puts the actual generated net value way down. Part of the problem here is that these costs are elsewhere and paid over a long periode of time in the future, so they have not showed up that much in historical data yet. Without some kind of intervension, then it is not possible to handle such negative side effects or keep having the general population actually have increasing wealth generation, as it comes down to issues like the tragedy of the commons, where the effect on one self is much smaller than the total effect, scewing the profit calculations.",negative

What does &quot;carajo&quot; mean? Well, &quot;carajo&quot;, was the basket of the Spanish caravels, at the top of the mast, where the lookout was located. But also, it was a place of punishment, of penance, and it was used as a threat: &quot;do it again, and you&#39;ll go to the carajo.&quot;<br><br>When trying to translate it into English, it has become &quot;Long live Freedom, damn&quot; or damn it.

It was the highest place on a ship, at the top and around the mast and above the yards. IT IS THE PLACE WHERE THE DISTANCES CAN BE SEEN, AND FROM WHERE THE SEEKER WARNS THE PROXIMITY OF FIRM LAND, OR OF A DANGER ON THE HORIZON. In Milei&#39;s case, he uses &quot;carajo&quot; for emphasis, using a word from &quot;lunfardo&quot; or slang,, from the town, and not from the academy.<br><br>When a sailor&#39;s behavior displeased the captain, he &quot;sent him to the carajo&quot;, where he had to stand, and without shelter from the wind and eventually, the cold and the rain. Hence, in the Río de la Plata (Argentina and Uruguay), &quot;carajo&quot; has an enormity of uses, depending on the context of the sentence: in this case, it is a word that gives emphasis: &quot;I&#39;m telling you this for the last time, carajo&quot;, and it is used in very diverse ways ( see dictionaries).

The west is socialist, but not by the common definition of socialism, but by his own.<br>2. Capitalism is good because &quot;it took more than 90% of the worlds population out of poverty&quot;. By the way that isn&#39;t true. According to PIP the percent of people under the poverty line worldwide  was 37.8% in the 90-s and only went under 10% in 2017. If you will also look at the whole graph you&#39;ll see that the poverty actually went and still goes down in &quot;time of the evil socialism&quot;.<br>3. &quot;Monopoly is good&quot;.

If the market is a truth teller, then why does it constantly lie to itself?<br><br>It&#39;s not like we live in an informational era where goods and services are marketed mainly through their to-be-perceived cultural relevance instead of more objective criteria. &quot;Buy X, and you&#39;ll look good in front of Y&quot; is what drives revenue today and what we see in ads... Where the fuck do you process any semblance of an objective and sane demand in this?<br><br>If a market that cares most about selling smartphones ABSOLUTELY NOBODY wanted anything to do with twenty years ago does not carry ideological bias, then call me a socialist, alright.<br><br>A free market isn&#39;t a catalyst for changes in consumption models, it&#39;s a catalyst for concentration in consumption models. It takes whatever the fuck works to generate transactions at the moment and forms obsessions, even bubbles, around it. This is not an expression of objective demand meeting objective supply, this is just an expression of collective craze.<br><br>When was the last fucking time the markets went insane over delivering quality and quantities of innovative food products? Yet, this is the pillar of us as a species: we need to eat. But the markets and their marketers don&#39;t give a flying fuck about food, whilst the average everyday man does give a fuck about it. When were the markets lastly crazed over concerns of making housing better? When were the markets lastly obsessed over making clothing durable and easy to wash over stimulating our innate need for cultural status through &quot;buy and dump&quot; fashion?<br><br>So why isn&#39;t supply meeting demand there, huh? Is it socialism again doing shady work? Or is it the markets failing to account for reasonable needs, favouring whatever stimulates our need for social recognition instead?<br><br>This is where libertarianism is blindsided. It acts as if we&#39;re reasonable, measured consumers. We&#39;re not, we can be engineered to buy anything, given enough investment for such engineering to work. Privately funded researchers just need to find out about any loophole in our biology/psychology and boom, marketers have new means of creating demand over goods and services that are secondary at best to our most important needs! Tell me, right in the eyes, that goddamn social attention addictions are expressions of objective and sane demands, that markets ought to satisfy with totally essential products such as Tik Tok and Twitter!<br><br>If we are to be so sure about the &quot;objective causality&quot; between what we want and buy and are compelled to buy, and what we actually need to be happy, then how the hell do hippies get along and happy with how bare and unorthodox their consuming habits are?<br><br>How do people willingly refuse to be part of market trends and still live happily?<br><br>Are there ghosts in Javier&#39;s machine?",positive

My question is how will it do so and how will we ensure that doubling world GDP will benefit everyone. It so often seems that the majority of the increases in wealth are retained in the hands of a few people. Multi-billion dollar companies like Amazon generate massive wealth for the small number owners and top leadership and very little for the large numbers of wage earners. By all means show me. I am not taken by any ideological system of thought. I go to work almost every day and what i see is huge rewards for business owners, top leadership, and investors, and small rewards for wage earners many of whom have large debts. I dont know what the answer is but, i dont see a bright future for the majority of the wage earners i work with. By all means, please explain to me how this will actually benefit people other than the already wealthy? This is not a complaint it is an actual question. I hear all these speeches by people on the left and right, pro and anti capitalism , pro this system anti that system and they all say the same thing. &quot;Our way will eliminate poverty and increase wealth.&quot; Well HOW?

Look, I don&#39;t see how any system man has come up with could do that...mainly because any system always requires some number of people to make decisions and move money around, and power corrupts...but of the system tried, capitalism is definitely not one to end poverty...it creates it.  Money flows from the many who have little to the few who have much.  Companies have the power to manipulate local and even the federal government, getting tax breaks and kick backs and even bailouts.   Companies grow larger, snuff out smaller operations and bully small suppliers. They always look to maximize profits, sending jobs over seas.  Even on a local level, those with more than they need buy up properties to rent out, building their wealth while making the housing market a harder place for new buyers to find a home.  Everywhere you look, the desire...not to have what you need but to be wealthy...means that those who achieve success receive 10, 20 or 100s of times the income for the same amount of time worked.   Meanwhile, professions crucial for a society, teaching, police, doctors, firefighters and more are often under paid or there simply aren&#39;t enough.

It is the interconnecting of most economies of the world. In fact, to make it short, one tries to produce goods at places where it is the cheapest. Hence, the whole world serves as a common market where everyone is in competition against each other to provide the cheapest prices for goods, so that other international customers will choose to buy in your country.<br><br>But the fact is that the West pushed hard to establish for full-blown globalization because it would serve the West the most. And the West almost achieved it. Had there not be the fact that China and Russia rebelled after 2014 and decided to not follow the “Rules-Based International Order” any longer, we would most likely sit in a fully globalized world nowadays. But China decided to establish its own vision of an NWO and globalization, and Russia as well. That led to major disruptions, after 2018, in the global supply chains and after the “Corona Years” to the death of the globalization.<br><br>Now take this into consideration. If the West had succeeded with its plan to divide Russia and gain access to all of Russia’s resources, China would have folded instantly. There have been four attempts to achieve this:<br><br>1) Napoleon.<br><br>2) Hitler.<br><br>3) Yeltsin, who enabled the Western effort to dismember Russia in the 1990s. The West tried that by inserting, training, and supplying Islamic terrorists in Russia’s Caucasus regions. This ongoing process was stopped and reverted when Vladimir Putin became President.<br><br>4) Ongoing efforts to turn around Russian allies located near Russia and to bring them into NATO. This involved terrorizing Russian populations in these former Soviet countries to a) induce Russia to attack them and b) to bring protest and conflict into Russia because of perceived weak Russian leadership. This would trigger large scale protests which would have been taken over as soon as success was in sight by pre-placed Western-trained puppet protest leaders. And then, doing again the same as was done with Yeltsin. Fighting bloody civil wars all across Russia and thereby making Russia fall apart.<br><br>That has been essentially the Western goal for at least 250 years. In fact, far longer, but my explanations started 250 years ago. If Russia and China folded or fell apart, the West would become the sole ruler over the whole world, since it would control almost all of the resources and markets and also be the unchallenged military power. This would usher in the New World Order, or the “Rules-Based International Order”. Now you might assume that the United States would lead this new world order. That’s entirely wrong. Never forget, especially if you are an American: Your only role in this scheme is to provide the military force to achieve the creation of the NWO, and afterwards to act as some kind of police force, when individual countries (Libya? Yugoslavia? Syria? etc.) decide to not follow the “Rules-Based International Order” (RBIO).<br><br>The Dynasties that control the finance system and the MIC, which are both hierarchically above the national governments, would use pre-established organizations to make themselves the undisputed rulers of some kind of world government. Which would have been the UN if Russia and China would have fallen.",negative

Examples like lobbying for certain regulations or companies making products that are designed to fail so you have to repurchase them. Companies paying for information to spread or covered that prevent regulation in there industry because that would hurt profits regardless if those regulations would be better for the consumers.

Like the pharmaceutical industry for example. The quality of our food is diminishing as companies want to make things last longer and spray extra chemicals on everything despite health concers its all about maming money.

From early times man has dreamt of an age of plenty. Prophets have foretold the coming of  a Utopia where work would be light and the material needs of life would be satisfy with ease and abundance for all. When for the first time in history the conditions for the realization of this dream seams nearly in their grasp, instead of confidence and hope fear fills the minds of men.&quot; Jame Maxton British Socialist MP",positive

He sounds like some of our former leader who wrote the US constitution which was based on Biblical principles. Our  fathers fled persecution from Europe from the union of  kings and papal powers that oppressed the people, the Dark Ages, to a better land to be govern by the people and for the people,  that is why USA prospered and was blessed. But now we are being deceived  by the prince of darkness and his evil agents  to control and take away our human rights . .<br>We are in the finals last and worst years of human history, climate change is not because of CO2 but signs of Christ&#39;s second coming to warn the people to prepare and not to be deceived,  read Matthew 24 and Revelation  chapters 13 The first beast is describing the Papacy and the second beast verse 11 is the USA.  To enforce the mark of the beast they must have central bank digital currency CBDC so you can not buy or sell.

He has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan&#39;s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts.” Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 294.2<br>For more info. see videos from Amazing Facts Ministry. God bless",positive

It is the SAME angle that Capitalists have been shouting for decades.  But, economic numbers are NOT the whole picture.  We have to look at stress on our planet, in the form of never-ending-growth.  This is NATURE.  No single species can overly dominate a closed habitat (the Earth), for much length of time.  <br><br>For example: we keep over-fishing.  We have started fishing FARMS... but the quality isn&#39;t the same.  You can&#39;t expect salmon in a closed &quot;farm&quot;, eating CORN of all things will stay a healthy fish to eat.  Within a few short generations we&#39;ll have some weird, non-nutritious white fish that has nearly ZERO benefits to eat.  Might as well skip the process and just eat corn.  This is just ONE example of how un-tethered Capitalism goes WAY off the rails.  Analysts who stay stuck in the financial only number NEVER seem to consider the bigger picture.  <br><br>Now, I&#39;m not saying that brutal, authoritarian Communism is the answer.  It&#39;s not.  But, we need a NEW system.  We need a system that does NOT waste, yet rewards innovation for sustainability.  Like with Capitalism, it causes companies to make things that BREAK often.  Because then people need to buy more.  This is WHY Capitalism is NOT sustainable.  Because we&#39;re just throwing stuff away for the purpose of making profits &quot;LOOK&quot; good on paper for awhile longer.  But the longer it goes on, the more unrecoverable this crap will be.  <br><br>Also, none of these VERY FEW points get into major financial inequality.  We&#39;ve got a SHITLOAD of homelessness in the USA.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s even worse in many other countries.  That problem keeps getting WORSE, with cut-throat Capitalism.<br><br>Check out my handle/name... &quot;QUESTION EVERYTHING!&quot;  It&#39;s because platitudes in speeches can easily sway someone who doesn&#39;t quickly question the deeper and wider picture.",positive

But what about the part about how the things being sold are contributing to the ruin of the earth? economic prosperity is still connected to producing nonessential products that pollute our water and end up in landfills. I What he’s saying makes sense from working within the current world system. And I don’t agree with collectivism as we see it today. But in America, 14 years ago our government created Citizens United. It gives corporations the same rights as American citizens and it’s the root of the wealth inequity we see today. Deregulation is not the answer. Libertarianism works on an individual level, but I don’t believe it will work on a governmental level. We must look beyond capitalism to solve the problems we face now. Capitalism is rooted in competition and production of goods. Both of which are killing the planet. They say that most jobs in the future will be done by machines. Where does that leave us? There is a huge global conflict looming between democratic nations and fascist communist together with Muslim nations. The stage is being set now by Xi and Putin. In the next 5 years they will try to bring democracy down. Democratic nations need to come together to protect the freedom that we have. The future will be won not by those who are morally superior, but by those who are strongly united in purpose. Democratic free nations cannot become divided over things like Palestine or Ukraine. We are coming into a time when we must come together with one voice and say no to facism. Regardless of what you think of the United States, we must come together to stand for democracy.

However, crony unrestrained capitalism like USA from 1865-1945 and 1990-present was a boom and bust economy that saw the top 1-10% getting ridiculously wealthy and the middle class struggling;and the rates of poverty that holds back the growth and development of USA and every country. So, capitalism that works for all. He is partially wrong about wealth-so much is inherited and hoarded. Incentives were not destroyed from 1950-1980 in USA when top marginal (and progressive)tax rates were 70-90% and so many corporations and people became very wealthy and the middle class exploded. Does he mean that taxes should be voluntary? If so he is living in the same dream world as those who want communism ism and collectivism. He also misses that there is capitalism in USA especially for corporations when times are good but when about to fail there is socialism in bailouts and tax breaks that hurt communities because roads, bridges, water, sewer, schools etc. all depend on tax revenue.

They own all of the assets and companies,  power companies, railroads, and their next agenda is to own every property in the entire planet.

Just to cite a few:<br>1. (AP 3 July 11, 2023) &quot;the U.N. warned Monday that at the current rate of global progress 575 million people will still be living in extreme poverty and 84 million children won’t be going to school in 2030 – and it will take 286 years to reach equality between men and women&quot; This las point justifies the &quot;feminist&quot; issue of fighting for equality.<br>2.

Africa holds 75% of the poorest countries. Its estimated that by 2030 will be home to 90 percent of the world’s destitute children <br>3. (Joseph, Peter. 2017. The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing the Economy to End Oppression) The market economy is based on cyclical consumption and it really doesn’t matter what is being produced, how it is being produced, or why. If demand or production slows, so too does the movement of money, and when this happens, the economy contracts, systematically reducing the standard of living for many. Economically, this means capitalism is structurally oblivious to humanity’s existence on a finite planet. The system wants to produce, not conserve. In fact, if you think about it, you will discover an interesting paradox to market logic: the fact that capitalism is a scarcity-based economic system that actually seeks infinite consumption <br><br>There are many more studies that contradict the well known propaganda are now accesible in the Web.

We need more people like this but the people behind the WEF will most likely not let this stand since he is in this lions den of socialists and neo communists. Calling them socialist and neo communists is not a complement. In fact it&#39;s a slam on their illegal take over of the world. They are illegally using a model of social engineering to control every person on this planet. The science they have created  and use is slowly moving everything and everyone to a bondage reality. Your country won&#39;t be in charge but will be under the WEF. Freedom is opposite of socialism and communism and government imposed laws. Freedom is personal responsibility for self, family and community in all areas of life. Socialists and neo communists do not take up responsibilities as adults should and only take handouts from a government. Those corrupt in power promote the idea of government dependence to grow the government to have greater control. Lazy people meet with free handouts from government equals more laws. The elite want more control over you. You are willing to give up freedoms to be lazy. This is no way to live. The US is at the tipping point of defaulting on its monetary system from all the billions of handouts! This is the plan of the elites involved with the WEF, which I turn are over your government and in your government. The US is no longer a democracy, people. We are going down fast into collective and personal bondage. What can we do? Start by getting rid of ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. This is often called sustainability. In a business context, sustainability is about the company&#39;s business model, i.e. how its products and services contribute to sustainable development. But it&#39;s not on an even playing field. ESG encompasses diversity and inclusion which is another socialist psyop. Social engineering is manipulation over us all. Be awake and not woke. I pray that this man lives and makes an impact against all of those in power that are plotting against you and I.",positive

Meaning that when we double a value of gdp ( about 27 years needed with only 3% GDP annually) we also double energy usage. New energy only add to existing supply and never replace previous methods( coal is still used today as well as solar/wind power). That trend is exponential for both GDP and energy consumption, meaning that in couple of hundred years with “ only” 3 % annual growth we will need more energy than the sun, in a thousand years we would need something like the total energy of our galaxy and so on and so on… NOBODY seems to understand and care/ think about the current situation with mathematical approach, and people could never understand the dynamic nature of exponential growth, this will kill not only us but also this planet. For those who argue that technology and science will make it possible, I would propose to read and understand what is the current situation with nuclear Fusion/ the breakthrough is always “around the corner” - for last century.. we will simply burn the resources of this planet ( as we do), destroying the natural climate and eradicating all the spices.

He is miles ahead of his western colleagues in this regard. As a libertarian leaning guy I would certainly vote for him. I do however see some flaws in his argument particularly on abortion. Also other social aspects than economics have to be considered in legislation. I for example have a counterpoint to the The libertarian argument against redistributing wealth  &quot;as it hurts overall economic growth&quot;. While it&#39;s true in a vacuum redistributing wealth results in everyone just becoming less rich than they could have been as growth will slow down and the cake becomes smaller.  There is one interesting social aspect this economic idea ignores. And that is: it is well documented that as inequality increase so does crime. The causality can be argued, but psychologically it makes sense that those who are the least fortunate in life will always envy those who have more than them. If someone is working their ass of 10 hours a day on minimal wage and they see someone sitting on his chair making 10000x what you make doing basically nothing, then no amount of free market theory will hinder a deep feeling of inequality and potential anger. When enough people are affected by this anger they will riot and/or ellect radical pro government politicians and thus hurt the economy. Therefore it is my belief that there is a sweet spot where you redistribute just enough wealth so that people don&#39;t become angry but at the same time allow for economic growth to take place. I know this may be immoral according to pure libertarians but I think in the real world it is necessary as the end result will be more government either way.  A pure anarco capitalist society only works if everyone one understands and 100% agrees with its premise, otherwise it&#39;s doomed to fail as the plebians will inevitably rebel against the system.",negative

Putting all the blame on &quot;socialism&quot; is an out-of-date left vs. right view.  Monopolization and corrupt practices of lobbyist and venture capitalism are out greatest dangers.  The state in many countries has become a tool of cartel-ism on the part of the biggest &quot;capitalist&quot; empires.  As such, the real problem is not the &quot;system&quot;, it&#39;s the corruption and dishonesty of it&#39;s members.  Look at the most successful and fair economies in the world. They are based on fairness and honest, sensible government in co-operation with capitalism.  I won&#39;t list the countries that are seen as the best and fairest in the world.  Any absolutist long-term undemocratic regime will become corrupt and this does not depend on capitalism or socialism.  Lack of honesty in both government and modern venture, shareholder focused oligopolization is what needs to be tackled. Yes to freedom and true open markets, but also to a right to provision of the basic needs of all human beings.  Once upon a time universal literacy was a pipe-dream.  What system made it a reality?

But most of the others in Latin America need help to push their economies towards the MUCH better numbers per Capita towards the first world status. I mean Slovenia, Czechia, Lithuania, Estonia, now got SUPER HIGH GDP PPP per capita. Similar level like Japan or the UK! All because of the EU unity. Same thing happened to Puerto Rico cause of the unity with the USA. Puerto Rico now got GDP per capita like the first world country! All because it joined the United States of America.

But then there is a seed, and this seed is citizen salary, where every citizen is paid each month enough currency to sustain food, house and local transport. <br><br>We should not waste tax money to investigate if people are worth food and houseing, we should not spend money to see if someone is poor enough to get help, we should all get citizen salary, and only encourage people into the capital system with its sweet fruit flesh as a reward.

@Firelech,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,0.0,"There is nothing new in this speech because it is a standard, intellectually barren, demagogic, self serving, faulty justification of a system of social production that relies on the physical and intellectual labour of the vast majority to produce goods, advance the productive forces through technology, mitigate problematic environmental outcomes, reproduce, educate and sustain the labour force, sustain health, protect the weak and elderly, provide necessary but unprofitable infrastructure, etc.  that system is capitalism, whether it’s slightly modified by humanitarian concerns such as public healthcare for example or whether it it’s closer to (in reality never extant) his more sociopathic ideal of totalitarian free market capitalism.  In contrast to the social nature of production, capitalism places command of production and allocation of its product in individual hands.  The social production is therefore directed and used for the selfish accumulation of vast social wealth in private hands, far beyond any rational accounting of the contribution of that class of people.  Anyone remotely acquainted with historical development understands that capitalism was a dynamic force for social development because it better suited social production than the decaying feudal system that came before it.  Capitalism is not freedom from the state.  It has always relied on state enforcement, coercion of society into conforming with the control and embezzlement of socially produced wealth.  It is well known that the state itself arose as a means to enforce private control of social wealth.  That is exactly what it did when it smashed and enslaved free societies of the indigenous across the globe during colonialism.  His main premise that socialism is repugnant to freedom because it entails enforcement of distribution of social wealth into social hands is nonsense because capitalism itself depends on state coercion, always.  Capitalism always relies on the state to also allocate whatever share of resources remain in public hands to facilitate private enrichment opportunities.  Clearly he resents the fact that the majority of society have managed to influence the state to some degree to provide some improvement of conditions for the producing masses.  The governments he is attacking are completely capitalist governments but mitigated by social gains won in struggle by the producing class.  To large degree they were able to do that due to the competing example of actual socialist governments.  Capitalists always rely on social welfare and only improve societal conditions when forced to by the masses in political struggle.  Argentina has been held back by what is now quite obviously an outdated irrational and harmful system of production and wealth allocation.  As an extremist and a fantasist he blames disarray on the sporadic ability of the producing masses to win some social concessions through the state whereas in fact the development of the economy is held back by the self serving sociopathic capitalist class that maintains fundamental control over the state and therefore its protection of their parasitic enrichment that is simply enforced diversion of social wealth to private hands.  His resentment of women’s reproductive choice and environmental management are a blatantly selfish fantasy relating to the social position he and his class are in.  Their greedy state enforced position is reflected in his moral fantasy that it somehow represents the essence of man.  The decay of western capitalism is exemplified in the social decay, hampered productivity, bloated scale of non productive financial swindles and general decline we see in the US as its empire crumbles.  Whereas countries such as China use elements of capitalism that still play a role in developing social production within overarching social control of social production and wealth distribution that is protected by the state.  His rule in Argentina will enrich his class while snatching back concessions.  It will cause chaos and resentment until it falls in disarray to those who will attempt to repair the damage.",positive

My parents and grandparents were working class and never in their lives worked more than 40 hours a week and had 1 full month paid vacation. The education was free and one of the best in the world. On top of that every citizen received an apartment in the city and a lot of land in the countryside to build a homestead FOR FREE from the government. People never paid a dime for their housing because it was FREE! Right now I am living in the &#39;richest&#39; free market economy in the world (USA) and I have to work 60-70 hours a week just to pay the rent and can&#39;t even save up for the downpayment to get a mortgage which I will have to pay for 30 years.

Also we cannot continue to grow on a forever linear path because there are limited resources, eventually markets plateau when resources run out, and that will cause an implosion of capitalism, and a collapse of civilization. Capitalism requires never ending resources and continual linear growth. Socialism is the end result of late stage capitalism, when the system starts failing as capitalism is unsustainable. Only way to overcome the unsustainability factor is to harvest vast resources via our solar system through significant investment/advancements in AI and space travel. Go Elon Musk. Also we need fusion power. Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking these elites are anti-capitalists, they are not. They are merely implementing &quot;solutions&quot; to the problem of late stage capitalism as they are able to observe the cliff the system is heading towards.  Basically they have benefited from capitalism and are trying to make it sustainable by causing controlled decline, centralizing the economy, and decreasing population growth so that they can hold onto their wealth and resources. The masses are using up too many resources and are too hard to control, so they need decline not growth. The general population can&#39;t see the cliff because they aren&#39;t heavily involved in macroeconomics, and therefore don&#39;t understand the elitist agenda. the Elites are pro-capitalists, but anti-democratic. They want us to be collectivistic and socialist, but for them it&#39;s full blown oligarchic/technocratic capitalism, because that is what benefits them the most. There really isn&#39;t an argument of capitalism vs socialism.",negative

Oh, the freedom of giving up your own currency! Because nothing says &#39;we&#39;ve lost our way&#39; quite like clinging to a foreign power&#39;s coattails. It’s not freedom; it&#39;s a fire sale of national sovereignty. Imagine, a country&#39;s economic leash held by another nation&#39;s central bank. Independence? More like dependence with extra steps.<br><br>And about this sell-off of national assets – it&#39;s not just a yard sale, it&#39;s a desperation move. They’re not just selling off assets; they’re practically giving them away in a time of crisis. It&#39;s Economics 101: You sell when the market’s booming, not when it’s glooming. But here they are, unloading valuable assets at rock-bottom prices. It&#39;s like hosting a bargain basement sale for your most prized possessions. The buyers are skipping with glee, snatching up bargains, while the country’s left holding an empty bag.<br><br>In this grand scheme of ‘economic revival,’ Argentina isn&#39;t striking a great deal. It&#39;s being cornered into a discount deal, where the real winners are the ones holding the foreign currency and snapping up assets. So, when they talk about &#39;radical economic reform,&#39; they&#39;re not setting sail for prosperous shores; they’re drifting towards an economic iceberg, and all they&#39;ve got is a ‘For Sale’ sign to patch the holes.",positive

We don&#39;t need to oversimplify everything under a single doctrine. I wish people just stopped these dumb fights, and focused on a balanced, honest, and perhaps even  boring government. Use capital where it&#39;s useful. And social programs to further human development, where it&#39;s also useful.

Hence, Orwellian doublethink is offered as the solution: we should assert social control to deny social control while happily enslaved in the name of market &quot;freedom&quot;. We should oppose “socialism” in the name of “free market capitalism” which is nothing but a new form of feudalism.

If this person was a true Libertarian he would not agree with any form of government or nationalism. True Libertarians are globalist free market ideologues.

It&#39;s curious that the end goal of both Communism and Libertarianism is the dissolution of the state itself. Neither have ever produced this so called utopia. We do not have true Capitalism,  we have croney Capitalism which is a form of fascism in which mega corporations have gone into business with the government in order to eliminate competition.  This was accomplished by the late 1800s. We need antimonopoly enforcement to enable Capitalism to function as intended.

What puzzles me is that China has had the fastest growing economy the world has ever seen, and they are a blend of capitalism and socialist state supported industries. Their banks are owned by the government and unlike USA where private investors get a piece of all the money originating from the FED well in China the government since it isn&#39;t private Invester based can even write off bad loans and does that on a lot of failed businesses. However more new businesses actually work out that the ones that don&#39;t. Their formula incubates in the end a heck of lot of winners. I have been for over 40 years starting and running my own businesses. I understand the value of having a personal stake in what you do and have even gone belly up several times and had to start over.

The biggest was in China for the past decade. Without that the world poverty would have been increased. This is the nonsense without nuances. Of course capitalism contributed significant to the growth of world economy. However unrestricted it will also bring a dog-eat-dog society. That is why we need law and order, which is why we have governments, but not bad governments headed by idiotic or ignorant leaders. We need good governments headed by smart, competent, leaders who are also operating under checks and balance. It is just a matter on how the leaders are selected, and what kinds of checks and balance mechanism is applied. This mechanism also should be well-balanced, to achieve long term benefits for the people. But I will keep an open mind to see how Mr. Milei&#39;s experiment will work out. I am deeply skeptical, because he is the head of the state yet he believes the state is the problem.

Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into <b>VRI TOKEN</b> Its more profitable.",positive

Free-market capitalism (without monopolies or government interference) brings prosperity and freedom. Socialism, where the state (which has a monopoly on violence) raises taxes from the people and  uses them to control the people, brings poverty and slavery. History has proven this over and over again.  Feudalism, which obtained throughout the world for millenia, is essentially the same as Socialism, which is why the old-money elites promote socialism. Lenin and Trotsky were funded by Wall Street and the Bank of England. The same so-called aristocrats funded Mao in China and Pol Pot in Cambodia.  Today, the central banking cabal, which controls the money supply in 170 countries, promotes socialism because their owners are would-be aristocrats who want depopulation, global control and a return to the good old days of masters and slaves.",positive

Some people say things like, it was a failure of the market to deal with such and such a social issue. For example, if someone is born without property in a country where education is not free, then the market will not be a successful medium to guarantee equality of opportunity (not outcome). And, of course, the problem with capitalism as a historical system is that it evolved out of the aristocratic relations of Europe, wherein a segment of the population began from year 1 with great swathes of property, and others were simultaneously disenfranchised through enclosure and sent to factories where the wages were not enough to build up any stable capital. If you continue forward through that story, democracy was only achieved at the beginning of the 20th century, after which time there were two catastrophic wars which reduced most of the continent to poverty, and they have only been climbing out of that state since. Contrary to what president Milei says, standard of living has been dropping in the West since the 1970s when calculated by purchasing power of the general population.<br><br>I did not write the above to advocate socialism or to claim that I have &quot;debunked&quot; the above speech, but only to point out a problem. I do not understand why many in this comment section see this speech as being radical, since it represents the ideas of the political mainstream since at least the 1980s. Every western country operates on a capitalist basis, even the social democratic ones which are not run through government planning but only differ through higher tax regimes and government spending, not in the operation of the market which are all open to competition, and there are no countries with completely unregulated markets and I doubt there ever will be because that would mean, among other things, allowing poisons into everyday products.",negative

Some in capitalism get stupid rich. But this wealth is not enough. They look around and see that the masses have escaped poverty and now have money. The wealthy covet this wealth and push governments to change policies so they can gain the property of the masses. Socialism is the way they choose to make the masses poor and enrich themselves. Thus we have the WEF (stupid rich) who never have enough.,positive

First penned by British Philosopher John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, they were used to defend the claim that all men are free and possess the inalienable right to Life, Liberty and Property independent from the laws of any specific society. This was part of the foundation Locke used to describe where the people under a social contract willingly transfer some of their fights to government in order to better enjoy the stable enjoyment of their Lives, Liberty and Property. Meaning, that under this social contract, the government exists with the consent of the governed to protect the rights of people and that governments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced by the people. Thomas Jefferson who respected Locke replaced the word &quot;Property&quot; with &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which he likely borrowed from Locke again who wrote in a 1690 essay titled, &quot;Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, &quot;The pursuit of happiness is the foundation of Liberty&quot;.

And because they have accumulated so many different products and for many years undercut everyone else, there is now nowhere else to go to buy some products at sensible prices.

The classic capitalism idea did not include financial systems running wild like they are, and the classic capitalism thinkers did not condone an unregulated financial system, only unregulated capitalism in the productive form.<br><br>So color me sceptic every time I hear someone praise capitalism, and then I wan&#39;t to ask ... what exactly do you mean by capitalism ?<br>One of the greatest and ignore problems in this world is the out of control financial system that has grown so big that capitalism, socialism, whatever ism doesn&#39;t really matter anymore - Only by addressing the problem of the financial system and the wealth accumulation by contributing nothing, can capitalism begin to work again.<br><br>The World Enslavement Forum agendas are very similar to feudalism, their member are the modern versions or Lords and normal people will be the serfs - Very much not capilism, but also no socialism (they only use socialism as a disguise).",positive

What he doesn’t say is that governments and corporations are owned by the same global Cult. So either way the same cabal is in control.<br>The obsession with economic growth for its own sake is classic free-for-all, child-like economics, in which the strongest, most wealthy and powerful, prevail without the most basic checks and balances.<br>Economic growth is merely the amount of money spent on goods and services. So all the negative things that we don’t want to happen are ticked as positive by economic growth if money changes hands and profits are made.<br>‘Freedom’ to be exploited by billionaires without redress is NOT freedom. Corporate monopolies with unchecked power is NOT freedom.<br>He talks about ‘capitalism’, but what he is describing in truth is cartelism.<br>It’s barely one-dimensional. It’s the playground. You challenge white with black and black with white while the Cult sits laughing in the shades of grey controlling both.<br>Milei is a child in a grown-ups’ playground appearing to challenge power while handing it over to the already super-powerful.

Don’t forget that there are people who grow more wealthy through supporting the selling of weapons to both sides of a conflict, whilst others deliberately rush to sink their money into defence stocks whenever a new war breaks out. The sad truth is this: capitalism thrives on the misfortunes of others and yet collectivism allows fewer to have wealth, but generally does not aid and abet the killing of others. Capitalist freedom vs Socialist servitude. Wealth is not the answer- freedom to live in unity with your brother / sister is the thing to aim for, surely? Also, there is much folly in assuming that GDP growth is real wealth growth. Don’t forget the effects of inflation and the increasing wealth inequality. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, no matter the political system. Just think back 10 years - sure you may have more money now, but is it worth as much as it once was?",positive

@Whoisemmanuel,2024-01-19 21:59:54+00:00,2024-01-19 21:59:54+00:00,0.0,"While the speech compellingly outlines the successes of capitalism, particularly in driving economic growth and reducing global poverty, it&#39;s crucial to also recognize the system&#39;s limitations and the potential consequences of unregulated capitalism. Indeed, capitalism has been a powerful engine for innovation and wealth creation, but its unchecked form can lead to significant social and environmental issues.<br><br>One stark example is the historical exploitation of labor, epitomized by events like the Coal Wars in the United States. During the early 20th century, coal miners faced incredibly harsh working conditions, low pay, and the constant threat of injury or death. Their efforts to unionize and strike for better conditions were often met with violent responses, including interventions by the National Guard. Such incidents underscore the potential for capitalism to exploit workers when devoid of strong labor protections and regulations.<br><br>Environmental impact is another critical area of concern. The pursuit of profit in capitalist systems can, and often does, lead to environmental degradation. This is evident in the contrast between industrialized and non-industrialized cultures. For instance, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, driven by the capitalist motives of logging, agriculture, and mining, starkly contrasts with the sustainable practices of indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with their environment for centuries. The current climate crisis, largely fueled by the carbon emissions of industrialized nations, is a testament to the environmental cost of unregulated industrial activity.<br><br>Moreover, the issue of social inequality is an inherent risk in capitalist systems. While capitalism can generate immense wealth, this wealth is often unevenly distributed, leading to significant disparities. The growing gap between the richest and the poorest, both within countries and globally, raises questions about the social sustainability of current economic models.<br><br>While capitalism has been a driving force in creating modern prosperity, its unregulated form can lead to labor exploitation, environmental destruction, and social inequality. These challenges highlight the necessity of thoughtful regulation and the implementation of policies that ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of human welfare and environmental sustainability. The goal should be to strike a balance where the dynamism of capitalism is harnessed, but its excesses are curbed, ensuring a fair and sustainable future for all.",positive

Reading some of these posts, the foolish people in our world don’t like what this man said.   I just cannot imagine the World Economic Forum welcoming him to speak, but thank goodness he did.  <br><br>Someone mentioned Capitalism.  Without Capitalism men and women would still be living in Medieval times.  At one time it was the Aristocracy of the world who kept the working population down.  Now the multiple Nouveau Riche throughout the world, are as bad, if not worse than they were.   The likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and many others have made their billions on the backs of the ordinary people of our world come to mind.  And socialism is not the answer, as that form of governance keeps people down.   We are NOT all equal in intelligence or work ethic.   But that is what these people at the World Economic Forum are telling us.  They think they have the right to rule us, and to take away our freedoms and rights as human beings.   <br><br>This gentleman has touched on everything that affects every human being’s life, and it is so wonderful to hear someone tell it like it is.  Our world is full of followers, not leaders.   And too many leaders in our world today have been won over to the dark side by the lure of money.

They always want more even if it is a little more. Dont underestimate the greed of the wealthy. They will still produce even if they do not make as much because they are taxed.

Milei errs in thinking that the elites are groups separate from the mega-corporations, when in reality they are the owners of the latter and all the crimes that we have seen increase to scandalous levels in these last four years are caused by mega-corporations, controlled by the elite that owns them, and that has managed to get into the pockets of every politician in every once prosperous country. In other words, he promises what we all want, but putting the shadow of the benefit of the popular doubt on delinquent businessmen.<br>Or someone is going to tell me that Gates, Bezos, and in Argentina, the two most powerful, are white doves... All the suffering that we have seen starting from the covid19 pandemic, the undeclared wars, the losses in pension equity funds, etc., all are the result of the excessive control that these billionaires exercise over the market, for which there is no mechanism to stop them. In effect, its abuse of monopoly power has eliminated the true creative capitalist force: small and medium-sized businesses, since large corporations have taken it upon themselves to eliminate them using politicians and their globalist 2030 agenda to make them cease to exist... True freedom will come when the excessive powers that corporations have compared to small businesses and individuals are eliminated.

And that when the GDP dominates the system as it does in free market capitalism, it devours and destroys other forms of wealth: morals, spirit, safety, justice, community. For example, drug and human trafficking cartels thrive. They amp up GDPs.  Wars send GDPs through the roof. Mr. Melei also fails to mention that mega corporations are faithfully bailed out of bankruptcy by the working class. The story of businesses that can&#39;t survive on their own going out of business is a dream--a nightmare for the general public that is squeezed out of business by voracious mega-companies taking over everything, metastasizing over the globe and recently, space. It&#39;s crystal clear that elites wouldn&#39;t be proposing any kind of social adjustment if they didn&#39;t realized free market capitalism has their backs against the wall with problems the system cannot address in any effective way. They became elites in the free market system, so obviously like it but they see that it can&#39;t hold together much longer.

It is better than Westminister, where everybody agrees with everybody else. When Starmer left the WEF, he was clutching his orders, and on his return to the UK, he announced labour policy change, and the new  policies he announced were straight from the WEF, and they mirrored the policies the WEF, Rishi Sunak is a WEF young leader and everthing does fall into what the WEF dictates. Sunak is happy for Starmer to be the next PM because he will be passing on the mantle to a fellow WEF believer and policy pusher. On the board of the WEF is Larry Finks of black Rock, who owns Vangaurd. Between the two companies, they own 8 trillion dollars of global assets and most of the world media companies. They use those the media companies to call anybody who questions the WEF plans for man an conspiracy theorists  to make them like they are mad and wears a tin foil hate. I would say 80% of the global population have no idea how they are munipulated to think how the WEF want them to think by media channels and news channels,  and via television programmes. It is a slow programming. They have found a new way, and that is to indoctrinate from the first day a child starts school. It is no accident how the woke culture is taught in our schools, from transgender to everybody who decides to leave their 3rd world country is a refugee. Mass immigration that is happening in Europe and the US is planned and paid for by an unknown group. I bet it is a group linked to the WEF and UN.",positive

Different socio-economic models have cons and pros. So far, free market is one of the most effective models but it has Achilles Spots and the tendency to monopolization is one of such weaknesses, it eventually renders free-market to become to be non-free market. So, antimonopoly regulation is required to fix it but any regulation contradicts free-market, such inconsistency of a pure free-market model can be resolved and it has been resolved in USA by slight modification of free market model from the middle   of 1930ths by antimonopoly acts; but, even an earlier version of free-market had such regulation (The Sherman Antitrust Act).",positive

While on the surface Javier’s screed hits many of the libertarian hot buttons (many of which I agree with) it’s critical to put this speech in context. This is the speech that the pirates will make just before picking your pockets and throwing you overboard to the sharks.<br><br>Milei uses gross generalities such as comparing abortion rights to a socialist form of population control, positioning all competing political groups/philosophies as parasitic soul sucking bureaucrats compared to his vision of a benevolent and perfect meritocracy of idealistic entrepreneurs. This is reminiscent of Ayn Rand’s juvenile nonsense. <br><br>Consider the absolutely critical inflection point the 2024 election represents. We are in the early stages of the four biggest societal transformations we’ve ever experienced: transportation, energy, labor and food (Hat tip: Adam Dorr’s “Brighter”). As we go through these transitions our society will necessarily go through some very difficult times as we are forced to abandon old ways of managing ourselves and adopt innovative --- and previously unacceptable --- new ways forward. We have two political paths to choose from this year to get us through this difficult beginning.<br><br> On the Democratic side we have a deep and wide bench of (mostly) well intentioned and capable public servants. In the last three years inflation has essentially been tamed (No, high prices aren’t inflation; they are the result of past inflation), unemployment is very low, massive investments are being made in supporting renewable energy, expansion of EVs and charging networks, fighting climate change, domestic production of microchips, basic infrastructure fixes, rebuilding of global alliances, decisive and strong support for Ukraine, Israel and NATO, and an absolute commitment to personal reproductive rights and our Constitutionally-based government. You don’t like Biden, fine; he’ll be gone before, or no later than, the 2028 elections. Our democracy is designed to refresh itself through election cycles. Don’t like something? Get engaged, vote, run for office and make changes within our system.<br><br>On the other side of the aisle is the GOP, which has completely transformed into MAGA. Of which their bench is one person wide and deep. And his intended legislative positions and historical record are literally the opposite of all the evidence and positions mentioned above. And this won’t be good for long term business. <br><br>If we, in the Tesla/Elon universe, can put aside our short term frustrations with Biden’s unhinged pro-union, Mary Barra fluffing words and focus on the actions and legislation that have actually occurred the choice becomes much clearer: We can abandon our Constitutional Republic and go with the know-nothing, prima donna, narcissistic, fascist cowboy or support and force change from within the progressive, evidence-based, forward thinking Democratic party.",positive

Notice China found a solution to all that by removing democracy from the equation, and capitalism seems to be working good there, and that makes more complex the dilemma for the west.

I hear him glorifying capatalism and demonizing socialism.  No civilazation can survive in the long term with such an inbalanced idealogy.  Its his right to share his idealogy but its hardly the only one and its freedom of choice that democracy is meant to protect.  My belief is that we should be careful to not summarize complex social economic concepts by naming them and using them as propoganda for movements.  It only creates an excuse not to think for ones self and that makes them easily exploitable.  They are only meant to be an introduction to an idea.,positive

It is like a warning and a wake-up call to all Western countries such as the US, who is walking down this path of eventual self-destruction. Socialism and the ever expansion of the government is NOT the solution to the problem of poverty and starvation of a country. It is just the people who are already in power, trying to control and disorient the normal citizens and make them believe that they are there to take care of them. Socialism leads to more power for the state, thus leading to more separation between the rich and the poor. Eventually, the gap will get so big that there will be division and civil unrest, thus leading to the collapse of that country. Argentina knows this well. They went through all of this within the last few decades. Our president in the White House better open up his ears and listen, as we are sliding down the same slope that will only end up in the collapse of our society.",negative

The type of people involved in this are of course morally bankrupt and together form a club that enjoys what once was considered the unspeakable deviation of every conceivable sort and many that are beyond the normal imagination. If you think that is a wild over statement be a fly on the wall of those in high office in any Western Government, or Royalty, particularly Washington, or WEFminster. Then delve into what happens in the tunnels and dark places below these buildings, and I include places of worship. You will need a strong constitution. It really doesn&#39;t matter how good the set up is, if those in charge are evil the direction of travel will continue downward. Adding to the decline over the years has been the secret societies like Freemasonry which is full of demonic references which demand greater adherence the higher the rank. Those beyond 33deg level only being for the top echelons of society. It can be no coincidence that as our spiritual lives have fallen into neglect, so our care for each other, and our responsibility for each other has tanked. Industrialists during the British Industrial Revolution were often staunch non conformist Christians, God fearing who expected to have to answer to a Deity for their dealings with those over whom they had huge power. They were the ones who paid a fair wage, gave bonuses, and provided safe clean places of work, even occasionally schooling for the children with nature trips out of the grime occasionally. The New Testament in those days was a force to be reckoned with ,and plenty of hell fire preachers giving sermons to packed churches. It was control of course, but a lot of it if done in the right spirit created good social practices that are not adhered to today .So in my opinion it is the collapse of moral standards no matter where they stem from that has created the situation we face, and only a speedy return to those origins that promote them will save us, and they certainly won&#39;t be found at Davos.",positive

I hope his election and presidency starts a chain reaction around the world. It kind of feels like that&#39;s starting to happen - but it&#39;s pissing off the Marxists... It&#39;s like, hang it up man - Marxism doesn&#39;t work and can&#39;t be reconfigured to be anywhere near as effective, free and productive as Capitalism - you tend to end up with psychotic dictators like Stalin, Mao, Kim, Pol Pot, etc.. Not to mention the fact that Marxism at its core - regardless of its stated purpose - stifles freedom and takes power and resources from the people and centralizes them into the hands of a few party members for supposed &quot;redistribution&quot; and those people invariably abuse their position to enrich themselves at the expense of the greater population... Capitalism isn&#39;t perfect either but unlike Marxism, it has been proven to work and enhance people&#39;s lives and enrich the population over and over - plus, Capitalism has the flexibility to adapt, evolve, improve, address its issues, etc. where Marxism remains rigid and stagnant. Also, the wealth produced in Capitalist societies allows for the funding of the abundant social welfare programs typically touted by Marxism. Personally, I think Capitalism works so well because it embraces human nature whereas Marxism (supposedly) tries - and fails - to fight it.",positive

The perplexing question is why all the sudden give this guy a platform there? No invite to Elon. I think it’s confusing or on purpose. Could be throwing people off the real agenda by appealing to itchy ears where the intended targets stick their heads back in the sand. It’s interesting he has this platform here and more so raising suspicion due to association. He very well could be well meaning and he is there for my previous speculation. It’s very opposite to the past stance coming from this organization.,positive

To begin with, he&#39;s a staunch supporter of Israel, a murderous, oppressive, racist State, currently executing one of the most horrific genocides in modern history. So one has to wonder how that jives with the libertarian ideas he so boldly proclaims. He&#39;s also closely linked to and sponsored by the Jewish Orthodox Jabad-Lubavitch organization that was recently in the news for some serious incidents involving secret tunnels at its headquarters in New York, with some very bizarre ramifications. In fact, he traveled there and visited said headquarters less than a month back.<br>It&#39;s fairly easy to make bold speeches decrying collectivism. Unfortunately, actions speak louder than words. Milei is not what he&#39;s made himself out to be. He recently issued what has been termed as a mega-decree, which is virtually tantamount to a full-fledged constitutional reform that would give the Executive full powers to do pretty much whatever it wants. This decree has yet to go through Congress, which is under the opposition’s control, but in Argentina that’s nothing that can’t be easily fixed with a few bribes. However, he might have to make some concessions in order to allow the opposition to save face. The decree includes one obscure article whereby the president is given the power to &#39;invite&#39; foreign military forces to conduct operations on Argentinean territory. No mention is made of what forces those might be, what the actual scope of their operations would be, or how long they would be allowed to operate on Argentinean soil. So, again, how is that consistent with less obtrusive governance and individual freedom, not to mention that it raises some serious questions about the man&#39;s allegiance. Bear in mind that Argentina has the third largest Jewish community in the world, and Patagonia was one of the locations considered by early Zionist leaders for the establishment of the State of Israel. Today, it stands virtually defenseless, as Argentina&#39;s military has been scaled down to operational unviability. To make matters worse, it is very scarcely populated. <br>So please, dig deeper, question, research. Don&#39;t be fooled by eloquent speeches. Investigate what goes on in back rooms behind closed doors.",positive

A free market economy has created a wealth disparity that is heading us back to the wealth structure of the eighteenth century, where most people were effectively slaves for the landed gentry. Just because GDP grows does not mean most of us are better off than our parents. The middle class grew out of the end of WW2, as home ownership (which is the cornerstone of being middle class) and peeked around 20 years ago. Modern day poverty always seems to be measured in monitory terms, but there are other ways to measure poverty. Loneliness, bad health, no future prospects to name a few which are becoming endemic in much of the world. The amount of money now in circulation is now around 280 T$, which is why GDP increases. But as a planet we are dying and simply increasing the speed that money moves around the planet will not bring the end of poverty for the majority.",negative

Something fishy is going on here - almost seems like the massive companies and businessmen comprising the economic forum have unleashed the fear of socialism on the population in order to spark a knee-jerk reaction by the populous involving going as far from that path as possible; a totally free market, leaving their own investments free to gobble up smaller competition and gain more wealth and soft power.",positive

As it stands,  they simply seek cheap labor elsewhere and we import goods from china.  It&#39;s a real dream, yeah right.   It works so well that all but a few are engaged in criminal activity of one degree or another.  Lawyers and judges go where the money is, not where the justice is.

Capitalism leads to the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.  Eventually, rich people will own the whole world if you give them the freedom to own everything and enslave everyone.  Rich people live like kings and queens and will never give up their wealth and power.  Rich people will kill as many people as needed to maintain their power over the world, and many more as needed to make an example of you so you don&#39;t forget and overstep your bound.  Rich people wants to brainwash the mass to believe that capitalism and freedom goes hand in hand, but that is to brainwash you to continue to support the current Western society so that rich people can continue to get even richer until they own the whole world and have everyone enslaved.  If freedom and democracy exists in a capitalist society, that would mean that the people voted to be poor and enslaved by the rich and that people gave away their freedom as slaves while the rich has unlimited freedom to enslave everyone.  Nobody voted to be slaves and nobody voted for the few rich people to have all the freedom to enslave the rest of the people.  The rich uses fear tactics to get people to support the current capitalist system.  The people are so brainwashed by the ideas of democracy and freedom and the fear of being enslaved and losing democracy and freedom that they can&#39;t even see that they are brainwashed into supporting their own enslavement.  Milei is spreading the same propaganda to his people, who are very ignorant of the world, so they naturally believe any propaganda of freedom, democracy, and capitalism.  If Americans fall for the same propaganda of democracy, freedom, and capitalism, it is very easy to see how the rest of the world can easily be brainwashed to support capitalism when it is falsely associated with democracy and freedom.  When you have freedom and democracy, you would vote for communism, not capitalism, because communism is about having a fair system that helps everyone equally.  Capitalism pretends to be the system that helps everyone equally, but in practice, it helps the top elites at the expense of the people.  You can observe capitalism in America operating.  The rich is getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The USA starts one war after another to siphon government debt into the pockets of the military industrial complex at the expense of American taxpayers.  After the USA destroys a country, it then lends loans for post-war reconstruction of that country.  When those loans are defaulted, the banks then owns those infrastructures and enslaves that country.  This is how the rich elite Americans pillage and enslave the world.  If a country is a communist country, the USA cannot debt trap that country and own that country (e.g., Russia).  By promoting capitalism through propaganda of democracy and freedom, the USA elites can invade, destroy, debt trap, and enslave any country it wants to.  Allies of the USA are just puppets of the USA.  These puppet governments are being bribed by the rich American elites at the expense of their people.  Milei is just another puppet of the USA.  How much is Milei being paid by the USA to sell the souls of his people to the American Devils?",positive

I will focus on this.<br><br>Capitalism, like all things, is not perfect, and he does not talk about its problems. One of the biggest is cost externalities, in which people not party to a transaction bear a cost. This sounds academic, but it manifests, for example, as mine owners dumping tailings into a river. Drinking water and fishing -- each being forms of natural wealth -- are depleted to save money for the mine owners, perhaps less than is non-consensually extracted from the river users. Protecting against cost externalities is a prime function of governments.<br><br>He also talks about how government should not provide services but instead let services be handled by businesses, since they are more efficient. One problem with this is, what does efficiency look like for a government entity? Take police, for example -- should they make a certain number of arrests to fulfill quotas? Should we have only private police? If you cannot afford private police, do you not get protection or justice? Governments (in democracies) take actions on behalf of citizens as demanded, and all are expected to pay up as appropriate for their economic status.<br><br>He speaks of taxes as a form of coercion. This is true, people with guns will lock you in a cage if you do not pay up. But where is a state without taxation? There are failed states, but these are run by warlords who extract tribute for protection -- taxes by another name. Taxes will ultimately be paid, and in exchange you (ought to) get civilization.<br><br>But let&#39;s say we magically get rid of taxes, and everyone lives without government. Then some people and together and start doing crime. What then? You will need to form you own autodefense group, complete with obligatory contributions in time, material, and money -- taxes again!<br><br>If socialists gain support criticizing capitalism, it&#39;s because they have a point -- many have their wants satisfied while many have their needs neglected. This is a problem libertarians do not acknowledge, capitalism&#39;s price signals do not distinguish between needs and wants: a rich person can buy all the water for their pool while the impoverished go thirsty. <br><br>He talks about capitalism being the greatest mechanism for wealth creation that the world has ever seen, and he talks about ever increasing GDP-per-capita figures, but behind this hides the distribution of that wealth. Who actually has it? Do those without it have enough to survive, to thrive, to challenge the wealthy with better business offerings? An enormous amount of wealth accumulated is coercive in its own right, and balanced only by the collective will of the people -- that is, the rule of law under a democratic government. <br><br>Milei is an extremist borne of extreme circumstances. Extremists are often have a point but are blinded to the flaws of their viewpoint. Just as the communists denigrated humanity for the promise of a utopia, Milei is so repelled by government that he cannot see its purpose.<br><br>I hope that he delivers the shock that Argentina needs to become peaceful and prosperous.

However, to suggest that Capitalism can&#39;t be moderated with &#39;social justice&#39; is just a Far Right wolf cry, and should be avoided just as much as Far Left calls to full socialism/communism.  Yes, GDP is growing more than ever now- however, the middle class is also SHRINKING now and their economic growth for the past 50 years has been almost flat.  You have to address these inequalities or the door opens for extremism.  Keep in mind &#39;pure capitalism&#39; drove monopolies and extremely poor working conditions for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Monopolies can raise prices through manipulation or short term cutthroat pricing which in the long term can hurt consumers. Also the state needs to insure costs are assigned to producers to properly reflect market conditions. Example is making sure oil companies are assigned cost of plastification of the seas and environment as well as carbons released. This can be done through regulations rather than excessive taxation which I agree is counterproductive. Other than those caveats I wholeheartedly agree.,positive
